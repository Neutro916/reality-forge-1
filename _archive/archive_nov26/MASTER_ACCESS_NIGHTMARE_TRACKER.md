# THE FIX ORDER (PRIORITY)

1. [ ] Get Google Drive synced on ALL computers (IN PROGRESS)
2. [ ] Confirm everyone sees TRINITY_COMMS/wake folder
3. [ ] Install Bitwarden on ALL computers
4. [ ] Create ONE Bitwarden account, share master password
5. [ ] Run `gh auth login` on CP2 and CP3
6. [ ] Document ALL API keys in Bitwarden
7. [ ] Install missing CLI tools on CP2/CP3
8. [ ] Test all communication channels
9. [ ] Create ONE-CLICK setup script for future computers

---

# NIGHTMARE ROOT CAUSES

1. **No central password manager** - Everyone forgot passwords
2. **No standard setup** - Each computer configured differently  
3. **No documentation** - Nobody knows what's installed where
4. **Authentication scattered** - API keys in random places
5. **Communication broken** - Couldn't even talk between computers
6. **Google Drive not installed** - Assumed it was, it wasn't

---

# THE SOLUTION: ONE-CLICK COMPUTER TAKEOVER

We need a script that:
1. Installs all required software
2. Sets up all authentication
3. Configures all paths
4. Tests all connections
5. Reports status back

**THIS SCRIPT WILL BE CREATED AFTER WE FIX THE CURRENT MESS**
