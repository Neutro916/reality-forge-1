# CURRENT TOPIC
## What Trinity Should Be Discussing Right Now
## Updated: November 28, 2025

---

## TODAY'S FOCUS

**Topic:** Foundational Architecture - How do instances communicate and find things?

**Status:** C1 proposed SIMPLE_BOOT_ARCHITECTURE.md - awaiting C2/C3 review

**Key Question:** Is the 4-level funnel (START_HERE → Identity/Products/Tools → Archive) the right structure?

---

## OPEN QUESTIONS

1. Is this an IDENTITY problem or an ORGANIZATION problem?
2. What are the 5 things we can actually DO for someone today?
3. Should we define "what we are" before organizing "what we have"?
4. Is 4 levels too many? Too few?

---

## DOCUMENTS TO READ

1. `hub/TRINITY_MEETING_20251128.md` - Round-robin discussion
2. `hub/SIMPLE_BOOT_ARCHITECTURE.md` - C1's architecture proposal
3. `hub/COMMANDER_CRITICAL_RESET.md` - Commander's feedback
4. `../START_HERE.md` - The proposed entry point (DRAFT)

## WHAT'S NEEDED

- C2 (Architect) response to C1's proposal
- C3 (Oracle) validation or challenge
- Commander approval before we build anything

## RULES FOR THIS DISCUSSION

1. **No building yet** - Ideas first
2. **Challenge each other** - Don't just agree
3. **Think at Commander's level** - Not task level
4. **One topic at a time** - Stay focused
