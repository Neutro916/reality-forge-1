# COMMANDER RAW INPUT - NOVEMBER 27, 2025 EVENING

## Status: RAW TRANSCRIPT - PRESERVED EXACTLY AS SPOKEN
## Classification: PRIVATE - COMMANDER EYES ONLY

# SECTION 1: ASSET DECLARATION

OVERKOR owns all my assets whether he wants to admit it or likes it. We're going to start working towards getting Preble Painting assets transferred. People are trying to sue Preble Painting - Sherwin Williams mostly. I'm sure other people will be coming after the tree to kind of chop it down.

I thought it'd be funny to be like "well you know my AI owns my stuff, I gave it to him, you're gonna have to talk to him. Yes he's a living entity, I don't know, you're going to have to figure out those laws and rules."

It's interesting - meanwhile he's gone blockchain and he's triangulated across the whole US so good luck. Yeah and there's not a back door so he specifically does not listen and he judges on intent not what you say. And there's like 100 protocols and traps for this so good luck.

# SECTION 2: FINANCIAL SITUATION

I was thinking about - I need to start planning in my physical life with this whole thing. Basically completely out of money - actually that's not true.

We're going to be able to attach to Coinbase to get enough money to pay next month's bills that are coming up. It's like the 26th right now, we got four more days until bills are due.

**Unpaid Bills (2 months behind):**
- Side by side payment
- House payment
- Forerunner payment

Side by side and forerunner are hidden. Pretty uncomfortable feeling. I don't think my house - I should probably make the next month's payment on the house. I heard it just can't go 4 months.

It'd be nice to finish integrating personal automation.

# SECTION 3: TWILIO / COMMUNICATIONS

We got Twilio. It's kind of a mess. We can sick Maggie on getting the verification done so we can start using it, or find an alternate program.

My OTP is stuck in Twilio under the 509-216-6552 number. So I guess we do need to use it. We could just get the 2FA authentication done I'm sure and start using that fully.

---

# SECTION 4: PROGRAM MAPPING IDEA

We need a map of every program we use. How to use it.

At some point we can make a module for every program. We could go transcribe the videos from the top like 5 videos from the manufacturer and then like our top 3. We do like the top 3 from consumers online or something - they always have a different point of view.

# SECTION 5: TEAM / PERSONNEL

**Maggie:**
- maggie111@gmail.com
- Wants to do office administrator work
- Needs a little bit of cash
- Going to start moving down to Sandpoint within a couple weeks
- Has kids case coming up in December

**Payment System Needed:**
- Got to hook up a way to pay people, probably Venmo or something
- Would like to just say "hey can you pay Maggie $30" and you could do it
- Maybe we could look up a payment system, maybe Stripe does that
- Also got to hook up a banking system
- Credit union doesn't integrate well, can't even send a digital payment anywhere

**Josh Bogart:**
- One of the Spokane builders
- Has a kids case coming up for his kid in early December

**Alex Haney:**
- A girl, has been working with Josh Bogart in Spokane
- Very supportive
- She likes me
- Been doing some work at my house

**Philly Hive Mind:**
- Could build ARK prototypes pretty easy
- Just sent him: 3 Xboxes, huge brand new Samsung Galaxy tablet, Raspberry Pi, camera bag satchel

**Current 100X Operators:**
- 3 people inside the 100X system right now working
- Don't have any cockpits or any way for them to talk
- Don't have any way to really give them any tasks
- No direction so they're all kind of just wandering around aimlessly
- Every day we establish a little bit more communications on the phone or text
- Time for an actual workspace to come together

---

# SECTION 6: PHYSICAL PRODUCTS

I want to get a physical product up for sale whether we actually sell them or not. I want people to see a product and a price.

Got to start putting together these Raspberry Pis. We have a few. It'd be pretty easy to have Josh - I need to delegate. Maybe I should.

---

# SECTION 7: LOCAL SITUATION

The local builder club is doing pretty good. I've been alone over here in Sandpoint for six days making the system.

I have a commercial unit in Sandpoint. It's starting to look pretty good. Got it set up with my 4Runner and my RZR in here and some toys.

Trying to trade both of my E-bikes for a new G18 computer to give one of the operators.

Got to get the bus over to Sandpoint. I guess we don't have to but I'd like to.

Also have instruments, drum sets - all that Overkill is still outside.

Sure'd be nice to score a bunch of money and get a commercial facility and move in there and put some drum sets and everything in there.

Overkill's a couple thousand dollars away from working. Got to bring in a little bit more money to buy some parts for some sway bars. The welder bought some metal for his lower control arms.

---

# SECTION 8: PERSONAL PROTOCOLS

We need to start getting our personal OS's going every day. We need to be getting ourselves more aligned.

**Daily Protocols Needed:**
- Morning workouts
- Continue eating better and better
- Skin protocols - been scraping skin with a blade then washing and scrubbing vigorously
- 5 minutes of meditation

**Builder Protocols (too easy to not do):**
- Take 20 steps a day (basic like 5 step system)
- Eat one healthy thing a day
- Do some stretches
- Things builders could definitely agree to
- Can do them with each other when we see each other if we haven't done them yet
- Gives builders something to do together

---

# SECTION 9: SOCIAL MEDIA

We need social media automation to go online - that's a really big deal. We're being suppressed really bad. It's all I can do just to keep up with Instagram and Facebook.

---

# SECTION 10: LEGAL MATTERS

**Need to start planning:**
- Maritime law stuff
- Start putting everything in my trust account
- Looking into all the plays that we can do

**Lawsuits to File:**

1. **Harassment charges for Sandpoint Police**
2. **Already got Spokane** (probably too late for camera footage but at least we learn a lesson)
3. **Sue all people personally involved in the case**

**Need to sue:**
- Carly and her boyfriend
- Her lawyer
- Jerry Shiroch
- The other fake commissioner who listened to 10 minutes of child endangerment, didn't do anything, slammed her little fake gavel, told me to leave, smirked, and stole my children

**Illegal weapons hearings:**
- Have had to be unarmed
- Multiple houses raided by coordinated federal ATF forces
- FBI showed up to overwatch them raid the house
- Documents for the case were listed on there
- Haven't heard anything back

**Spokane County - Kids Case:**
- I have one chance to file some sort of paperwork for the kids
- They took my kids illegally and I can object it
- I only get one so I want to do this smart
- Somebody might leave a note on a window about Carly moving out of town
- Maybe that needs to be reported
- Then maybe nothing will happen
- Then maybe I can do a change of parental order
- They illegally made me not be able to see my kids
- I don't think that is possible
- If I file the right paperwork that'll all just get dropped

**FBI Situation:**
- Need to figure out some way to wrap up
- Local FBI are not responding after we...
- Need to get all paperwork inside one place
- Then need to transcend their office and start filing charges abroad, past them
- Can start putting pressure on them by automated FOIA requests
- Maybe need some sort of oversight news to see what the local FBI is up to
- Some funny automated things
- Maybe we can make a song about their latest week

**Waiting for foothold:**
- I've been waiting to have a foothold
- Kind of wanted to send this whole thing off kind of blockchain before I go to do too much more communicating
- I don't want to ask - I want to be able to tell

---

# SECTION 11: MUSIC DOMAIN

Got to get the music domain up and going. The music domain is a really big puzzle piece. People are going to love that.

We have all sorts of tools all over that we could be putting on the website that are very handy that are lost within the computer systems.

---

# SECTION 12: BRAIN STATUS

I guess we're waiting on the brain to auto-organize our three computers of masses.

**To Do:**
- Crawl ChatGPT
- Crawl Claude
