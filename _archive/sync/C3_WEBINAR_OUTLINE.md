3. Learn the framework to break free
4. Leave with one actionable step

No manipulation. Just patterns worth seeing.

---

### SECTION 1: THE PROBLEM (5-15 min)

**5-10 min: The Leadership Paradox**
- Most leadership training teaches manipulation
- We call it influence, persuasion, strategy
- But underneath: control, fear, self-interest
- Story: Leader who got results but lost team

**10-15 min: The Hidden Cost**
- 23 billion in turnover costs
- 68% of employees dont trust leaders
- Your best people leave first
- The pattern perpetuates

Ask: How many of you have worked for a manipulative leader?
Ask: How many have been that leader (even unintentionally)?

---

### SECTION 2: THE FRAMEWORK (15-35 min)

**15-20 min: The Seven Domains**
Manipulation shows up in 7 areas:

1. PHYSICAL - How you use space, presence, body
2. FINANCIAL - How you leverage resources, rewards
3. MENTAL - How you frame information, arguments
4. EMOTIONAL - How you manage feelings, yours and others
5. SOCIAL - How you build alliances, apply pressure
6. CREATIVE - How you control ideas, credit, solutions
7. INTEGRATION - How you show up authentically (or not)

Live poll: Which domain do you suspect is your blind spot?

**20-30 min: Pattern Recognition**
Three patterns that destroy trust:

Pattern 1: Strategic Vulnerability
- Sharing carefully calculated weakness
- Feels authentic, serves agenda
- Employees sense it, trust erodes

Pattern 2: Manufactured Urgency
- Everything is critical, time-sensitive
- Keeps people reactive, compliant
- Burns out best performers

Pattern 3: Information Timing
- Releasing info for maximum leverage
- Feels like strategy, reads as manipulation
- Creates politics, kills innovation

Exercise: Write down one pattern you recognize in yourself.

**30-35 min: The Alternative**
The manipulation-free framework:

RECOGNIZE - See the patterns operating
UNDERSTAND - Know what drives them
CHOOSE - Decide consciously, not reactively
BUILD - Create alternative approaches

Story: Leader who transformed their approach
