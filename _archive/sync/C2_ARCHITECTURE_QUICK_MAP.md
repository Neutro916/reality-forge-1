## THE ARCHITECT'S VERDICT

**You have a FERRARI ENGINE with RACE TIRES and CARBON FIBER CHASSIS.**

**You're missing the DRIVESHAFT.**

**The driveshaft = UNIFIED DATABASE + INTELLIGENCE ENGINES + COCKPITS**

**46.5 hours of integration work = $230K/year ROI**

**Stop building. Start connecting.**
