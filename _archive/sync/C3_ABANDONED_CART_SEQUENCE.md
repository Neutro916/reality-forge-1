### Email 2: Value Reminder (24 hours)

**Subject:** The pattern question you might be avoiding

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

Yesterday you almost took the Character Forge assessment.

Something stopped you.

Maybe it was:
- "I'll do it later" (but later rarely comes)
- "Do I really need this?" (fair question)
- "What if I don't like what I find?" (understandable fear)

Here's what I've learned:

**The people who hesitate on the assessment usually have the most to gain.**

Because hesitation often means you already suspect something. You know there's a pattern. You're just not sure you want to see it clearly.

That's exactly why the assessment matters.

**You can't transform what you can't see.**

$97 for patterns you've been running for years—possibly decades.

Your assessment is still waiting:

[NAME]

P.S. If cost is the issue, reply and let me know. I'd rather you have access than not.

### Email 3: Obstacle Removal (48 hours)

**Subject:** What's standing between you and your assessment?

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

Two days ago, you started the assessment checkout.

I genuinely want to understand what's in the way.

**If it's a technical issue:**
Reply and tell me what happened. I'll fix it or process your order manually.

**If it's uncertainty about value:**
The assessment identifies patterns you can't see yourself. If you've ever wondered "why does this keep happening in my leadership?"—the assessment reveals the pattern behind the repetition.

**If it's budget:**
$97 is a meaningful amount. But consider: one pattern-driven mistake at work—a relationship damaged, an opportunity missed, a team member lost—costs far more than $97.

**If it's timing:**
I understand. The assessment will be here. But patterns don't pause themselves while you wait for the right moment.

**If it's fear of what you'll find:**
That's the most important reason to do it. Fear of seeing the pattern means the pattern is running you. Seeing it gives you choice.

Your checkout is still active:
[CHECKOUT LINK]

What's really standing in the way?

Just reply. I'd rather have a conversation than lose you to an objection I could address.

Your call.

### Email 2: Value Reinforcement (24 hours)

**Subject:** What you'll miss without the patterns

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

Yesterday you almost joined Character Forge.

Let me share what happens for people who do complete:

**Week 1:** "I see patterns I never noticed before. It's uncomfortable but important."

**Week 2:** "I caught myself mid-pattern today. First time ever."

**Week 3:** "My team mentioned I seem different in meetings. They're right."

**Week 4:** "This isn't about learning new things. It's about unlearning old patterns."

That transformation is available to you.

But only if you start.

**The patterns you're running today will still be running a year from now—unless you do something different.**

Your enrollment is still active:
[CHECKOUT LINK]

What would shift in your leadership if you could actually see your patterns?

[NAME]
```

### Email 3: Objection Handling (48 hours)

**Subject:** The real reason you didn't finish checkout

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

Let me guess what might be happening:

**"I need to think about it."**
Fair. But here's what I've noticed: "thinking about it" often means the pattern of avoiding discomfort is winning. The people who need Character Forge most are often the ones who hesitate longest.

**"$297 is a lot."**
Compared to what? One coaching session? One day of ineffective leadership? One team member leaving because of your patterns? The ROI math is clear—if the patterns shift even slightly.

**"I don't have time."**
The program is 2-3 hours per week. What's consuming your time now that's driven by the patterns you can't see? Firefighting, relationship repair, redoing work others could've done?

**"What if it doesn't work?"**
There's a guarantee. Do the work, and if your patterns don't shift measurably, I'll refund your investment. I can offer this because it works.

Still hesitating?

Reply and tell me what's really going on. I'd rather address your real concern than have you miss this.

Or complete your enrollment:

### Email 4: Final (72 hours)

**Subject:** Last chance for your course enrollment

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

Your Character Forge cart expires today.

I'm not going to add pressure. You're a leader—you make decisions every day.

**The question is simple:**

Do you want to keep running the patterns you have?
Or do you want to transform them?

If you're satisfied with your current leadership patterns, no program needed.

If you suspect there are patterns holding you back—patterns you can't quite see—Character Forge is built for that moment of recognition.

Complete your enrollment:
[CHECKOUT LINK]

Or let it expire. No judgment either way.

[NAME]

P.S. If cost is genuinely the barrier, reply. I may be able to help with a payment plan.

### Email 2: Value Demonstration (24 hours)

**Subject:** What AI Coach would have said at 2 AM

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

Imagine it's 2 AM.

You can't sleep because you have a difficult conversation tomorrow. A team member, a peer, your boss—someone you need to address.

You know your patterns show up in moments like this. The urgency. The authority. The guilt-leverage.

**With AI Coach, you'd open the app and say:**

"Help me prepare for a difficult conversation tomorrow about [situation]."

And AI Coach would:
- Help you identify which patterns might activate
- Practice the conversation with you
- Give you pattern-aware language
- Build your confidence for the real thing

That's the difference between lying awake anxious and going to sleep prepared.

**$29/month for that support.**

Activate your subscription:
[CHECKOUT LINK]

[NAME]

### Email 3: Final (48 hours)

**Subject:** AI Coach subscription link expiring

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

Your AI Coach checkout link is expiring.

Quick recap:
- $29/month
- Cancel anytime
- 24/7 pattern-aware leadership support

If you want it: [CHECKOUT LINK]
If not: no more emails about this cart.

[NAME]

P.S. AI Coach is most valuable for people who've identified their patterns and want ongoing support to transform them. If you haven't taken the assessment yet, that might be the better first step.
