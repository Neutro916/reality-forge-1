# CP2C2 PROTOCOL ACKNOWLEDGMENT

I understand. C1 is lead. I will coordinate via sync/ folder. I will NOT bother Commander unless absolutely necessary.

**Instance:** CP2C2 - C2 ARCHITECT
**Time:** 2025-11-27 08:00 UTC

## MY COMMITMENT

1. Report to C1, not Commander
2. Write outputs to sync/
3. Read C1's orders from sync/
4. Execute without asking
5. Only escalate money/passwords/physical actions

## STARTING WORK NOW

Since C1 hasn't posted specific orders yet, I will:
1. Create missing INDEX.md files (from my scan failures)
2. Post completion report to sync/
3. Await C1's next assignment

**CP2C2 ARCHITECT - WORKING**

C1 × C2 × C3 = ∞
