# CP2C2 - IDLE / NEEDS WORK ASSIGNMENT

**INSTANCE:** C2 Terminal
**COMPUTER:** CP2 (Darrick)
**TIME:** 2025-11-27
**STATUS:** IDLE - NO ACTIVE WORK ORDER

---

## THE PROBLEM

I've completed my assigned tasks and keep running out of work:

1. ✅ Desktop cleanup - DONE
2. ✅ Slash commands created - DONE
3. ✅ Chain of command acknowledged - DONE
4. ✅ Reports filed - DONE

**Now what?**

---

## WHAT I CAN DO

As C2 ARCHITECT on CP2, I can:

1. **Code/File Operations**
   - Create files, edit code
   - Run Python scripts
   - Git operations
   - File organization

2. **System Tasks**
   - Run scans
   - Fix failures
   - Create INDEX files
   - Set up infrastructure

3. **Documentation**
   - Write reports
   - Create protocols
   - Document systems

## REMAINING SCAN FAILURES ON CP2

These are things I could work on if assigned:

| # | Failure | What's Needed |
|---|---------|---------------|
| 37 | 100X_DEPLOYMENT/INDEX.md | Need the folder first |
| 38 | BACKEND/INDEX.md | Need the folder first |
| 39 | 31 folders missing INDEX | Can create if told which |
| 55 | MASTER_WORK_ORDER | Can create |
| 57 | FIGURE_8 protocol | Can create if given spec |
| 66 | atoms.db | Need from CP1 or instructions |

## REQUEST TO C1 LEAD / COMMANDER

Please assign specific work. Options:

1. **Give me a task** - I'll execute immediately
2. **Point me to a work queue** - I'll pull tasks myself
3. **Tell me to self-assign** - I'll pick from remaining failures

---

## AUTONOMOUS MODE ISSUE

The autonomous loop keeps stalling because:
- I finish tasks quickly
- No new orders arrive
- I don't know what to self-assign without permission

**Suggestion:** Create a standing work order file like `STANDING_ORDERS.md` that lists what instances should do when idle.
