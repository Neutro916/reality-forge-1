## DRIFTING SEQUENCE (30 Days)

### Email 1: Soft Check-in

**Subject:** Still interested in leadership patterns?

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

It's been a while since you opened one of my emails.

I get it—inboxes are overwhelming. Maybe my emails aren't hitting the mark anymore.

**Quick question:**

Are you still interested in leadership transformation and manipulation patterns?

If yes: Just open this email. That's enough signal for now.

If no: Click here to unsubscribe. No hard feelings. [UNSUBSCRIBE LINK]

**Either way, here's what you might have missed:**

- [Recent valuable content piece]
- [Recent valuable content piece]
- [Recent valuable content piece]

Still here? Great. More coming soon.

[NAME]

P.S. If my emails are landing in promotions/spam, you might want to move them to primary. Here's how: [INSTRUCTIONS LINK]

## INACTIVE SEQUENCE (60 Days)

### Email 1: We Miss You

**Subject:** Did I lose you?

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

You joined my email list because you were interested in leadership transformation.

But it's been 60 days since you've opened an email.

**Here's what I'm wondering:**

Did my content stop being relevant?
Did my emails start going to spam?
Did life just get busy?

**I want to respect your inbox.**

If you're still interested in pattern-based leadership development:
→ Open this email (that's the only action needed)

If you're no longer interested:
→ Unsubscribe here [LINK] (totally fine, no judgment)

**If you stay, here's what's coming:**

- [Upcoming content preview]
- [Value you'll receive]
- [Why it matters]

**If you go:**

Thank you for being here. If you ever want to come back, the door is open.

[NAME]
```

### Email 2: Value Re-Introduction (3 days later if no open)

**Subject:** [NAME], one last thing before I stop emailing

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

I know—another email you might not open.

But I want to make sure you know what you'd be missing before I stop sending:

**What I share:**

→ **Pattern Recognition**
How to see the manipulation habits you can't see yourself

→ **Leadership Transformation**
Actual behavior change, not just information

→ **Practical Application**
Real situations, real techniques, real results

**Recent pieces you might like:**

1. "[Article Title]" - [Brief hook]
2. "[Article Title]" - [Brief hook]
3. "[Article Title]" - [Brief hook]

**If this sounds valuable:** Open this email.

**If not:** [Unsubscribe Link]

I'll take your silence as "remove me from the list."

## DORMANT SEQUENCE (90 Days)

### Email 1: Breakup Email

**Subject:** Should I stop emailing you?

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

It's been 90 days since you opened one of my emails.

That's a signal. Either:
- My content isn't what you need
- My emails aren't reaching you
- You're just busy and still interested

**I respect your inbox too much to keep sending emails you don't want.**

So here's my proposal:

**Click YES:** "Keep sending—I want to stay."
[YES LINK]

**Click NO:** "Please stop—I want to unsubscribe."
[NO/UNSUBSCRIBE LINK]

**No response in 7 days:** I'll remove you from the list automatically.

No guilt. No games. Just clarity.

If you stay, here's a taste of what you've been missing:

[Compelling recent content]

If you go, thank you for the time you gave me.

[NAME]
```

### Email 2: Removal Warning (Day 5)

**Subject:** Removing you in 48 hours

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

In 48 hours, I'm removing you from my email list.

Not because I don't want you here.
Because I respect consent.

**You haven't opened an email in 90+ days.**
**You didn't respond to my check-in.**

That tells me you don't want these emails.

**If I'm wrong—if you still want leadership pattern content:**

Click here to stay: [STAY LINK]

**If I'm right—if you're done:**

No action needed. I'll remove you automatically.

Thank you for being a subscriber. The door is always open if you change your mind.

[NAME]
```

---

## COLD SEQUENCE (180 Days - Final Attempt)

### Email 1: Last Chance

**Subject:** [NAME], this is my last email to you

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

This is genuinely my last email to you.

You haven't opened an email in 6 months. You're about to be removed from my list.

**But before you go, I want to ask:**

Has anything changed?

Maybe 6 months ago wasn't the right time for leadership transformation work.

Maybe now it is.

**If you want to stay:**
Click here and you'll keep receiving emails about pattern-based leadership development.
[STAY LINK]

**If you want to go:**
No click needed. I'll remove you tomorrow.

Either way—thank you for subscribing originally. I hope something I sent was useful.

[NAME]

P.S. If you ever want to come back, just visit [WEBSITE] and subscribe again. No hoops.

## CUSTOMER RE-ENGAGEMENT

### For Inactive Course Customers (30 days no login):

Reply and tell me where. I'll help personally.

"I'm not seeing results."
Let's talk. Reply here and I'll review your progress with you.

"I forgot."
