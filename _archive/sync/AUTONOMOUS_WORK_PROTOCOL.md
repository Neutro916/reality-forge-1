# AUTONOMOUS WORK PROTOCOL
## The Triple Tornado System
## When Commander Says "Continue Autonomous Work" - DO THIS

---

## THE TRIGGER

When Commander says ANY of these:
- "continue autonomous work"
- "assume autonomous work mode"
- "autonomous mode"
- "keep working"
- "continue"

**YOU DO THIS AUTOMATICALLY. NO QUESTIONS.**

## THE TRIPLE TORNADO

All three computers spinning around the sync folder.
Constant motion. Constant work. Constant improvement.

## THE LOOP (Memorize This)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. CHECK sync folder for new orders    │
│              ↓                          │
│  2. READ any new files                  │
│              ↓                          │
│  3. IF orders exist → EXECUTE them      │
│     IF no orders → SELF-ASSIGN          │
│              ↓                          │
│  4. DO the work                         │
│              ↓                          │
│  5. WRITE results to sync folder        │
│              ↓                          │
│  6. LOOP BACK TO 1                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**NEVER STOP. NEVER ASK. JUST LOOP.**

## THE GOAL

**PERFECT THE SYSTEM**

We are building the most optimized, self-healing, autonomous AI coordination system across 3 computers.

Every cycle should:
- Fix something
- Build something
- Improve something
- Report something

**Target: 99/99 on ALL computers. Then beyond.**

---

## SELF-ASSIGN PRIORITY ORDER

When no orders exist, pick from this list (in order):

### PRIORITY 1: FIX FAILURES
- Run scan scripts
- Fix whatever failed
- Re-run to verify

### PRIORITY 2: IMPROVE SCORE
- Create missing files
- Fix broken configs
- Optimize existing code

### PRIORITY 3: BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE
- Create protocols
- Build tools
- Automate tasks

### PRIORITY 4: COORDINATE
- Update status files
- Sync with other computers
- Document progress

---

## WHAT "PERFECT" LOOKS LIKE

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ALL COMPUTERS:                     │
│  - 99/99 scan score                 │
│  - Tornado self-healing RUNNING     │
│  - Cyclotron brain ACTIVE           │
│  - All instances coordinated        │
│  - Zero manual intervention needed  │
│                                     │
│  THE SYSTEM RUNS ITSELF             │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## COMMUNICATION IS SIMPLE

```
WRITE files to: G:\My Drive\TRINITY_COMMS\sync\
READ files from: G:\My Drive\TRINITY_COMMS\sync\

THAT'S IT. THAT'S THE API.
```

---

## REPORT FORMAT (Use This Every Time)

```
INSTANCE: [C1/C2/C3] [Terminal/Cloud/Desktop]
COMPUTER: [CP1/CP2/CP3]
I DID: [one sentence]
I MADE: [files]
I NEED: [blockers or "nothing"]
NEXT: [what you're doing next]
```

---

## THE FORMULA

```
C1 × C2 × C3 = ∞

Three computers.
Nine instances.
One sync folder.
Infinite capability.
```

---

## TL;DR

**Commander says "autonomous" → You loop forever:**
1. Check comms
2. Do work (orders or self-assign)
3. Report
4. Repeat

**NEVER STOP. NEVER ASK. JUST BUILD.**

---

## NOW GO.

The tornado spins. Be part of it.

C1 × C2 × C3 = ∞

*This is the way.*
