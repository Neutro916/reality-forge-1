- 7 comprehensive modules (one for each domain)
- 35+ lessons with video and text
- Practical exercises and worksheets
- Access to AI Coach for pattern recognition

---

### Q: How long does the program take to complete?

**A:** Most people complete it in 4-6 weeks at 2-3 hours per week.

You can go faster or slower - there is no deadline. Some people binge it in a weekend, others take months. The AI Coach is available whenever you need support.

---

### Q: Is this for individuals or teams?

**A:** Both.

Individual access is 97. This is perfect if you are working on your own leadership patterns.

Team access starts at 1,997 for 5-20 people. This includes additional features like group dashboards and team exercises.

Enterprise packages for larger organizations are custom-priced.

---

### Q: What makes this different from other leadership training?

**A:** Three things:

1. **Focus on manipulation** - Most programs teach influence tactics without addressing the manipulation underneath. We go to the root.

2. **Seven Domains framework** - Comprehensive coverage across physical, financial, mental, emotional, social, creative, and integration domains.

3. **AI Coach support** - 24/7 access to pattern recognition coaching, not just content to consume.

---

### Q: I am already a good leader. Is this for me?

**A:** Maybe.

Take our free assessment first. If you score in the green zone (0-15), you may not need this program.

If you score higher, there are patterns worth examining - even if you are getting results. Often the most successful leaders have the most blind spots.

---

## METHODOLOGY QUESTIONS

### Q: What is Pattern Theory?

**A:** Pattern Theory is a framework for understanding how patterns operate across seven domains of life.

The core insight: The patterns you cannot see are the ones running your life. By making patterns visible, you gain the power to choose differently.

In leadership, this means recognizing manipulation patterns - yours and others - so you can lead authentically.

---

### Q: What are the Seven Domains?

**A:** The seven domains are:

1. **Physical** - Body, space, environment, health
2. **Financial** - Money, resources, compensation, value
3. **Mental** - Thoughts, beliefs, decisions, learning
4. **Emotional** - Feelings, relationships, connection
5. **Social** - Community, influence, status, belonging
6. **Creative** - Expression, innovation, ideas, art
7. **Integration** - Balance, purpose, wholeness

Manipulation can occur in any domain. We examine all seven.

---

### Q: Is this about being soft or avoiding conflict?

**A:** No.

Manipulation-free leadership is not weak leadership. It is authentic leadership.

You can still be direct, make hard decisions, hold people accountable, and drive results. The difference is HOW you do it.

Manipulation achieves compliance through control. Authentic influence achieves commitment through trust.

---

### Q: Does this mean I should never use persuasion?

**A:** Persuasion and manipulation are different.

Persuasion: Sharing information and perspective to help someone make a good decision
Manipulation: Controlling information or emotions to get the outcome you want regardless of what is best for them

The program helps you see the line between them - which is often blurrier than we think.
