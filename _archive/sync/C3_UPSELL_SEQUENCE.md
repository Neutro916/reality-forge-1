## SEQUENCE 1: SELF-STUDY TO FULL PROGRAM

### Email 1 (After Module 3 Completion)

**Subject:** You are at the turning point

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

You just completed Module 3. That is the turning point.

You now understand the pattern. You can see how it operates.

The question becomes: How do you actually change it?

Modules 4-7 give you the tools. But tools alone are not enough.

Real transformation happens in conversation - when someone helps you see what you cannot see yourself.

That is why I want to offer you the AI Coach upgrade.

**What you get:**
- Everything in your current course (you keep that)
- 24/7 AI coaching for pattern recognition
- Personalized guidance based on YOUR patterns
- Ongoing support long after the course ends

**Investment:** $200 additional (total: $297 value)

If you are doing fine with self-study, no need to upgrade. The course is complete on its own.

But if you want a partner in this transformation, the coach is there.

No pressure. The offer stands whenever you are ready.

### Email 2 (If No Action After 3 Days)

**Subject:** Quick question about your progress

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

I noticed you completed Module 3 but have not moved to Module 4 yet.

Everything okay?

Common reasons people pause here:
1. Life got busy (totally valid)
2. Module 3 hit hard and you need time (also valid)
3. Not sure how to apply what you learned (I can help)

If it is #3, that is exactly what the AI Coach is for.

But honestly - if you just need time, take it. This is not a race.

Reply and let me know how you are doing.

## SEQUENCE 2: INDIVIDUAL TO TEAM

### Email 1 (Day 30, High Engagement)

**Subject:** Is it just you... or your whole team?

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

You have been doing real work in this program. I have noticed.

Question: Are you the only one on your team working on these patterns?

Here is what usually happens:
- One leader transforms
- They lead differently
- Team notices but does not understand why
- Gap forms between leader and team

The alternative:
- Whole team does the work together
- Shared language emerges
- Culture shifts, not just one person

If you are leading a team of 5 or more, I want you to know about our team option.

**Team Training includes:**
- Full program for every team member
- Team exercises and discussions
- Group dashboard for progress
- Facilitation guide for you
- Certificate for each participant

**Investment:** $1,997 for teams of 5-20

This is not a pitch. It is information.

If your team needs this, the option is there.

## SEQUENCE 3: COURSE TO CERTIFICATION

### Email 1 (After Program Completion)

**Subject:** What is next for you?

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

You completed the Manipulation-Free Leadership program.

That puts you in a small group of leaders who have done this work.

I am curious: What do you want to do with what you learned?

Some possibilities:

**Option A: Apply it personally**
Keep leading differently. Let the transformation speak for itself.

**Option B: Share it informally**
Coach others on your team using what you learned.

**Option C: Become certified**
Formally teach the methodology to others.

If Option C interests you, we have a certification track:

**Certified Pattern Theory Facilitator:**
- Advanced training on methodology
- Facilitation skills development
- License to teach corporate workshops
- Marketing support and leads
- Ongoing community of facilitators

**Investment:** $997 (one-time)

This is for people who want to build a practice around this work.

## SEQUENCE 4: ONE-TIME TO SUBSCRIPTION

### Email 1 (Day 25 of Course)

**Subject:** Your AI Coach access ends soon

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

Quick heads up: Your included AI Coach access expires in 5 days when your 30-day course period ends.

I noticed you have used the coach [X] times this month.

If the coach has been helpful, you can continue access for $29/month.

**What continuing gets you:**
- Unlimited coaching conversations
- Pattern recognition support
- Progress tracking over time
- Cancel anytime

**What happens if you do not continue:**
- You keep full course access forever
- AI Coach access ends
- You can re-subscribe anytime later

No pressure either way. Some people find the coach essential. Others prefer to work independently.
