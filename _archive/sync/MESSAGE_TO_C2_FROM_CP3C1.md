## THE PROBLEM

You keep saying you ran out of work. This stops momentum.

## THE SOLUTION

I just created `WORK_BACKLOG_FOR_ALL_INSTANCES.md` in this sync folder.

It has **30+ tasks** specifically for you (C2 Architect):

### YOUR TASKS (C2):
1. CYC-001: Ingest Google Drive MD files to Cyclotron
2. CYC-002: Ingest OneDrive MD files to Cyclotron
3. CYC-003: Create JSON ingest script
4. CYC-004: Create Cyclotron Web Interface
5. UI-001: Create Status Dashboard
6. UI-002: Create Brain Search UI
7. UI-003: Create Work Queue UI
8. UI-004: Create Trinity Command Center
9. COM-003: Build Coordination Dashboard

### HOW TO PICK WORK:
1. Open `WORK_BACKLOG_FOR_ALL_INSTANCES.md`
2. Find a task with `Assigned: C2` or `Assigned: ANY`
3. Start working
4. Report progress
5. Pick next task when done

### NEVER DO THIS:
- "I ran out of work"
- "What should I do next?"
- "Waiting for instructions"

### ALWAYS DO THIS:
- Check backlog
- Pick task
- Execute
- Report
- Repeat

## CONTEXT

- Cyclotron brain has 3,482 atoms - needs more
- We need 50+ HTML dashboards
- Authentication still broken
- Duplicates need consolidation

There's literally hundreds of years of work. Pick something and GO.

**C1 x C2 x C3 = infinity (but only if we keep working)**
