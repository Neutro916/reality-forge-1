## EMAIL REFERRAL REQUESTS

### Email 1: The Soft Ask (Day 45)

**Subject:** Quick favor?

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

You have been in the program for a while now.

If it has been valuable for you, I have a small favor to ask.

Do you know one leader who might benefit from this work?

Not someone who would sign up for anything - someone who is actually ready to look at their patterns.

If a name comes to mind, I would appreciate you sharing this with them:

[REFERRAL LINK]

They will get [BENEFIT] and you will get [BENEFIT] when they join.

If no one comes to mind, no worries at all. The favor is only if it is natural.

Thanks for being part of this.

### Email 2: The Value Share (Day 60)

**Subject:** Something to share with your team?

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

A few of our members have asked for something to share with colleagues - a way to introduce Pattern Theory without it feeling like a pitch.

So we created this:

[LINK TO SHAREABLE RESOURCE]

It is a 5-minute read on the Seven Domains. No sales pitch. Just value.

If you have teammates or peers who might find it interesting, feel free to forward.

If they want to go deeper, they can take the free assessment.

### Email 3: The Direct Request (Day 90)

**Subject:** Would you recommend us?

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

Honest question: Would you recommend this program to a peer?

If yes - here is an easy way to do that:

[REFERRAL LINK]

When someone joins through your link:
- They get [BENEFIT]
- You get [BENEFIT]

If no - I would genuinely like to know why. Reply and tell me what would make this more recommendable.

Either answer helps.

Thanks,

[SIGNATURE]

## REFERRAL PROGRAM RULES

### Do:
- Share with people you genuinely think would benefit
- Use your personal experience in recommendations
- Be honest about your results

### Do Not:
- Spam your contacts
- Make claims we have not made
- Pressure anyone to sign up
- Share with people just to get rewards

### We Will:
- Honor all valid referrals
- Pay rewards within 30 days of purchase
- Never spam people you refer
- Credit you even if link tracking fails (let us know)

---

## REFERRAL TRACKING

### How It Works:

1. You get a unique referral link
2. When someone clicks and purchases, you are credited
3. Rewards are applied to your account or paid out
4. You can track referrals in your dashboard

### If Link Does Not Work:

If someone signs up but your link was not tracked:
- Have them email us with your name
- We will credit you manually
- We err on the side of crediting you
