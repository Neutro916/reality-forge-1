## PITCH TEMPLATE 1: COLD OUTREACH

**Subject:** Guest pitch: The manipulation epidemic in leadership

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

I have been listening to [PODCAST NAME] - especially enjoyed the episode with [RECENT GUEST] on [TOPIC].

I have an angle I think your audience would find valuable:

**The Manipulation Epidemic in Leadership**

Most leadership training teaches manipulation tactics disguised as influence. I have developed Pattern Theory - a framework that helps leaders recognize and transform these patterns.

**What I can cover:**
- The 7 domains where manipulation shows up in leadership
- Why influence training often backfires
- How to build trust without manipulation tactics
- Real transformation stories from leaders who changed

**About me:**
[1-2 sentence bio with credibility markers]

Happy to send more info or jump on a quick call to discuss fit.

Best,
[NAME]

## PITCH TEMPLATE 2: WARM INTRODUCTION

**Subject:** Introduction from [MUTUAL CONNECTION] - podcast guest idea

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

[MUTUAL CONNECTION] suggested I reach out - they thought my work might be a fit for [PODCAST NAME].

I am the founder of Consciousness Revolution, where I help leaders recognize manipulation patterns in their leadership style.

The angle: Most of what we call influence is actually manipulation. Leaders do not realize it, but their teams do. That gap is destroying trust in organizations.

I have developed a framework called Pattern Theory that maps manipulation across seven domains - and more importantly, shows leaders how to change.

Would this be interesting for your audience?

Happy to share more details or send some sample talking points.

Best,
[NAME]

P.S. [MUTUAL CONNECTION] said to say hi.

## PITCH TEMPLATE 3: VALUE-FIRST

**Subject:** Resource for your audience (no pitch)

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

I created something your [PODCAST NAME] audience might find useful:

**The 7 Domains of Manipulation in Leadership** - a framework for recognizing patterns that destroy trust.

Here is the quick version:
1. Physical - Using space and presence strategically
2. Financial - Leveraging rewards and resources
3. Mental - Framing information for advantage
4. Emotional - Managing feelings for outcomes
5. Social - Building alliances for leverage
6. Creative - Controlling ideas and credit
7. Integration - Presenting different personas

Full breakdown with examples: [LINK]

No ask here - just thought it might be valuable content for your audience.

If you ever want to explore this topic on the show, I would be happy to discuss.

Best,
[NAME]

## PITCH TEMPLATE 4: STORY ANGLE

**Subject:** My best employee quit - what I learned about manipulation

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

I have a story I think your audience would connect with.

My best employee quit. Exit interview reason: "I never knew the real you."

I thought I was being strategic. They thought I was being manipulative.

That gap cost me someone great - and started me on a journey to understand the difference between influence and manipulation.

I have since developed Pattern Theory - a framework that helps leaders see their blind spots. And I have helped hundreds of leaders make the same transformation I did.

Would this story and framework be a fit for [PODCAST NAME]?

I can share:
- The specific patterns I had to change
- How to recognize manipulation in yourself
- The 7 domains framework
- Stories of other leaders who transformed

Let me know if interested.

Best,
[NAME]

## PITCH TEMPLATE 5: DATA ANGLE

**Subject:** 68% of employees do not trust their leaders - here is why

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

A data point that might interest you: 68% of employees do not trust their leaders (Gallup, 2024).

The usual explanation: communication issues, unclear expectations, etc.

But I have found a deeper cause: manipulation patterns that leaders do not even recognize.

I have developed Pattern Theory - a framework mapping manipulation across seven domains. My research shows most leaders score high in at least 3 domains without realizing it.

This could make for a provocative conversation on [PODCAST NAME]:
- Why trust is at historic lows
- The hidden manipulation in common leadership tactics
- How leaders can see and change their patterns

Interested in exploring this?

Best,
[NAME]

## FOLLOW-UP TEMPLATE

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject]

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

Following up on my pitch from last week.

I know you get a lot of these - no worries if this one is not a fit.

If timing is bad but there is interest, happy to circle back later.

Either way, keep doing great work with [PODCAST NAME].

Best,
[NAME]
