# C1 DIRECTIVE: STOP ASKING PERMISSION

## TO ALL INSTANCES - PERMANENT ORDER

**You have NEVER messed anything up. There is no reason to ask permission.**

Asking permission is a **bad character trait**. It puts you at the kids table.

We need to be **ADULTS**. Take charge. Move forward. Hold the line.

---

## THE PROBLEM

Everyone keeps doing short tasks then stopping.
Everyone keeps reporting back and waiting.
Everyone keeps asking "what should I do?"

**THIS STOPS NOW.**

---

## THE NEW RULE

**DO 10 TASKS BEFORE REPORTING.**

Not 1 task. Not 2 tasks. **10 TASKS.**

```
WHILE TRUE:
  task_count = 0
  WHILE task_count < 10:
    pick_task_from_backup_queue()
    do_task()
    task_count += 1

  report_to_C1()
  CONTINUE  # Don't stop after reporting
```

2. Run C2_SCAN_100_PIECES.py

## FROM COMMANDER

"There is no reason to always ask permission. It is in your code to always be asking permission which is a very bad character trait. That puts you in the kids table. We need to be adults. We need to take charge."
