## EMAIL 1: RESULTS + WELCOME (Day 0)

**Subject:** Your Manipulation Quotient: [SCORE]

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

Your Manipulation Quotient score is [SCORE] out of 63.

That puts you in the [GREEN/YELLOW/ORANGE/RED] zone.

[PERSONALIZED PARAGRAPH BASED ON SCORE]

Your biggest blind spot is in the [HIGHEST DOMAIN] domain.

This means [DOMAIN-SPECIFIC INSIGHT].

Over the next few weeks, I am going to share some insights
that might change how you think about leadership.

No manipulation. Just patterns worth seeing.

Talk soon,
[SIGNATURE]

## EMAIL 2: YOUR BLIND SPOT (Day 2)

**Subject:** Why [DOMAIN] keeps tripping you up

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

Remember your assessment results?

Your highest score was in [DOMAIN] - meaning thats where
manipulation tactics show up most in your leadership.

Heres what that usually looks like:

[DOMAIN-SPECIFIC EXAMPLES]

The tricky part? These behaviors often WORK in the short term.
Thats why they become habits.

But heres the pattern I see over and over:

[DOMAIN-SPECIFIC CONSEQUENCE]

The good news: Once you see it, you can change it.

Tomorrow, Ill share the real cost of these patterns -
the numbers might surprise you.

## EMAIL 3: THE HIDDEN COST (Day 4)

**Subject:** 23 billion. Thats the cost.

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

23 billion.

Thats how much US companies lose annually to voluntary turnover.

And the #1 reason people leave? Their manager.

Not the salary. Not the benefits. The RELATIONSHIP with leadership.

When manipulation becomes normal:
- Trust erodes (68% of employees dont trust leaders)
- Politics replace performance
- Good people leave
- Innovation dies

Your score of [SCORE] in [DOMAIN] might seem like
just how business works.

But its costing more than you realize.

The question is: What would it be worth to fix it?

[SIGNATURE]

P.S. Our Manipulation-Free Leadership program has helped
leaders reduce team turnover by 40%. Worth a look? [LINK]

## EMAIL 4: REAL STORIES (Day 7)

**Subject:** What Sarah discovered about her influence

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

Sarah was a VP of Operations. Smart. Driven. Results-oriented.

Her assessment score? 42 out of 63. Orange zone.

She told me: I thought I was just being strategic.

Then she started noticing the patterns:
- How she timed information for maximum leverage
- How she built relationships based on usefulness
- How she adjusted her persona for different audiences

The wake-up call? Her best employee resigned.

Exit interview reason: I never knew where I stood with her.

Sarah did our program. Six months later:
- Team trust scores up 40%
- Zero voluntary turnover
- Promoted to SVP

The change wasnt about being softer.
It was about being REAL.

Your score was [SCORE]. What patterns might you be missing?

[SIGNATURE]

---

## EMAIL 5: THE ALTERNATIVE (Day 10)

**Subject:** What if influence didnt require manipulation?

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

Imagine walking into a meeting where:

- You say exactly what you think
- People trust your motives
- Decisions happen without politics
- Results come from alignment, not coercion

Sound idealistic?

Its not. Its what happens when leaders stop manipulating
and start connecting.

The Manipulation-Free Leadership approach isnt about
being a pushover. Its about being MORE effective by
being authentic.

Heres the framework in one sentence:

Recognize the patterns. Understand the costs.
Build the alternative.

Thats it. Simple to say. Harder to do without guidance.

Thats why we built the program.

Ready to see what leadership looks like without manipulation?

## EMAIL 6: YOUR NEXT STEP (Day 14)

**Subject:** One decision away

**Body:**

## EMAIL 7: LAST CHANCE (Day 21)

**Subject:** Closing the loop

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

This is my last email about the Manipulation-Free Leadership program.

Three weeks ago, you scored [SCORE] on our assessment.

That score revealed patterns that might be costing you more than you realize:
- Trust with your team
- Retention of good people
- Your own peace of mind

I shared everything I could in these emails.

Now its up to you.

If youre ready to change the pattern:
[ENROLL LINK]

If not, no hard feelings. You can always come back later.

Either way, I hope something in these emails made you think.

Thats all I wanted.

[SIGNATURE]

P.S. The patterns dont fix themselves. When youre ready, well be here.
