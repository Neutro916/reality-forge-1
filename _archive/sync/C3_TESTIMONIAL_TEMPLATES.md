Templates for requesting testimonials without manipulation.

We provide structure but never words to use.

## TEMPLATE 1: POST-COMPLETION REQUEST

**When:** 48 hours after program completion

**Subject:** Your experience matters to us

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

Congratulations on completing the Manipulation-Free Leadership program.

You have done real work. That takes courage.

If the program was valuable for you, would you be willing to share your experience? Your words could help someone else who is where you were.

No pressure. Completely optional.

If yes, here are some questions that might help:

1. What made you decide to take this program?
2. What did you discover about yourself?
3. What has changed since?
4. Who would you recommend this to?

A few sentences is plenty. Or more if you are moved to share.

Reply to this email or use this form: [LINK]

Either way, thank you for the journey.

Now that your team has completed the training, I wanted to ask:

Many organizations considering this ask: Has it worked for companies like ours?

Your voice as [ROLE] at [COMPANY] would carry weight.
