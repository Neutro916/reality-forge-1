## ASSESSMENT PURCHASE ($97)

### Email 1: Welcome (Immediate)

**Subject:** Your Assessment Access is Ready

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

Welcome to Character Forge.

You've just taken the first step toward leadership transformation that most people never take: looking honestly at your patterns.

**Your assessment is ready:**
[ASSESSMENT LINK]

**What to expect:**
- 15-20 minutes to complete
- 40 questions about your leadership behavior
- Be honest—no one sees this but you
- Results delivered instantly

**One request:**
Find a quiet space. Turn off distractions. Answer based on how you actually behave, not how you wish you did.

The patterns you identify today could change everything about how you lead.

### Email 2: Reminder (24 hours if not started)

**Subject:** Your patterns are waiting to be discovered

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

You purchased your Character Forge assessment yesterday, but I noticed you haven't started yet.

No pressure—but I want to make sure nothing's in the way.

**Common reasons people delay:**
- "I'll do it when I have time" (there's never a perfect time)
- "I'm not sure I'm ready to see this" (that resistance is information)
- "I got distracted" (understandable—here's your reminder)

**The assessment takes 15-20 minutes.**

That's less than most meetings. And it could reveal patterns you've been running for years.

### Email 3: Results Delivered (Immediate after completion)

**Subject:** Your Pattern Profile is Ready

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

Your Character Forge assessment is complete.

**Your results are ready to view:**
[RESULTS LINK]

**What you'll see:**
- Your dominant patterns (the big ones affecting your leadership)
- Your Seven Domains profile (where patterns show up most)
- Pattern intensity scores (how strong each pattern is)
- Transformation priorities (where to focus first)

**How to read your results:**
- Don't judge—observe
- Patterns aren't character flaws—they're adaptations
- High scores aren't "bad"—they're information
- This is the starting point, not the finish

**Take your time with this.**

When you're ready to go deeper—to actually transform these patterns—your next step is the Character Forge program.

But first, just sit with what you've learned.

### Email 4: Processing Check-in (48 hours after results)

**Subject:** How are you processing your results?

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

You received your pattern profile a couple days ago.

How's it landing?

**Common reactions:**

😯 "That's... scarily accurate."
Most people recognize themselves immediately.

🤔 "I'm not sure I agree with all of it."
That's okay. Sit with it. Ask people who know you.

😬 "This is uncomfortable to see."
Good. Discomfort means growth is possible.

💡 "Now I see why [situation] happened."
That's the beginning of transformation.

**What to do next:**

1. **Notice your patterns this week.** Don't try to change yet—just observe.

2. **Consider who else sees these patterns.** They probably do, even if no one's said anything.

3. **When you're ready to transform** (not just see)—that's what the full program is for.

Your patterns won't change by themselves. But they can change.

[NAME]

P.S. Reply with your biggest "aha moment" from the assessment. I read every response.

### Email 5: Upsell Introduction (Day 5)

**Subject:** Seeing patterns is the first step. Changing them is the journey.

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

By now, you've had time to process your assessment results.

You know your patterns. You might be noticing them more.

But here's what I've learned:

**Awareness alone doesn't create change.**

You've probably experienced this before:
- Reading a book that made perfect sense... and changing nothing
- Attending a workshop that felt powerful... and returning to old habits
- Having an insight about yourself... and forgetting it within weeks

**The gap between knowing and doing is where transformation happens—or doesn't.**

The Character Forge program bridges that gap:

✓ **Pattern Recognition Training** - Catch yourself in real-time
✓ **Transformation Practice** - Build new responses
✓ **AI Coach Support** - 24/7 reinforcement
✓ **Progress Measurement** - Prove you're changing

Your assessment showed you the patterns.
The program transforms them.

**Special offer for assessment customers:**

P.S. Not ready for the full program? The assessment insights are yours forever. But patterns don't transform themselves.

### Email 6: Gentle Follow-up (Day 10)

**Subject:** Still thinking about transformation?

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

A quick check-in.

You've had your assessment results for about a week now.

I'm curious: **Have you noticed your patterns showing up?**

Most people tell me they start seeing their patterns everywhere once they know what to look for.

The meeting where you used urgency to push something through.
The conversation where you pulled rank instead of engaging.
The moment you made someone feel guilty to get compliance.

**Seeing is the first victory.**

But if you're like most people, you're also feeling something else:

"Now that I see it, how do I stop?"

That's the work of the full program.

No pressure. Just know: the patterns will keep running until you transform them.

## COURSE PURCHASE ($297)

### Email 1: Welcome (Immediate)

**Subject:** Welcome to Character Forge - Let's Begin

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

Welcome to Character Forge.

You've just made a decision most leaders never make: to transform your patterns, not just learn more tactics.

**Your course access is ready:**
[COURSE LINK]

**Here's your quick-start plan:**

📋 **Step 1: Complete your assessment** (15-20 min)
This personalizes your entire journey.

📚 **Step 2: Watch the Introduction** (10 min)
Understand how to get the most from this program.

🎯 **Step 3: Begin Module 1** (30-45 min)
Start recognizing your patterns.

**My recommendation:**
Don't try to binge this like Netflix. The transformation happens in the practice between modules, not the watching.

One module per week. Practice in between. That's the path.

If not: No judgment. But I'd encourage you to start today. Momentum matters.

**What people find most valuable in Module 1:**

### Email 3: Week 1 Milestone

**Subject:** Week 1 Complete - What You've Accomplished

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

You're one week into Character Forge.

**Take a moment to acknowledge:**

If you've completed Module 1 and started Module 2, you now have:
- Your personal pattern profile
- Understanding of pattern origins
- Seven Domains framework
- Initial recognition skills

**That's more self-awareness than most leaders ever develop.**

**This week's focus: Recognition Practice**

Module 2 is about catching patterns in real-time.

The goal: Notice at least 3 pattern moments this week.
- Not stopping them
- Not judging them
- Just noticing

Write them down. You'll use these later.

**Question for you:**
What's been the most surprising pattern recognition moment so far?

Just reply—I read every response and it helps me understand what's landing.

### Email 4: Week 2 Milestone

**Subject:** The Messy Middle

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

Week 2 of Character Forge.

If you're feeling something like this, you're on track:

"I see my patterns everywhere now and I can't stop them."

This is the messy middle. It's supposed to feel this way.

**Here's why this discomfort matters:**

Before Character Forge: Patterns running automatically, unconsciously
Now: Patterns still running, but you SEE them

**That "gap" between seeing and stopping is where transformation happens.**

Keep practicing. The "seeing" gets faster. Then the "choice point" appears—the moment where you can do something different.

That's coming.

**This week's focus: The Moment of Choice**

Module 3 introduces interruption techniques.

The patterns don't go away—you learn to catch them and choose differently.

You're doing the work. Keep going.

Continue Module 3 →

[NAME]

P.S. The discomfort is temporary. The transformation is permanent.

### Email 5: Week 3 Milestone

**Subject:** Are you practicing?

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

Week 3. Time for an honest check.

**The content is only 20% of the transformation.**
**The practice is 80%.**

Watching modules: Information
Practicing techniques: Transformation

**How to know if you're on track:**

✓ You've caught yourself in a pattern this week
✓ You've tried a different response at least once
✓ You've reflected on what happened
✓ You've used the AI Coach (if included)

**How to know if you're off track:**

✗ Watching modules without practicing
✗ Knowing your patterns but not noticing in real-time
✗ Waiting until you "finish" to start applying

**The finish line isn't the last module.**
**It's when your patterns actually change.**

Module 4 deepens your practice. But only if you've been practicing.

### Email 6: Week 4 - Completion Celebration

**Subject:** You Did It 🎉

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

Congratulations.

If you've completed the Character Forge program—truly completed it, with practice—you've done something remarkable.

**You've seen patterns most people never see.**
**You've practiced changes most people never attempt.**
**You've transformed in ways that will compound over time.**

**What happens now:**

1. **Keep practicing.** The patterns will try to come back. They won't fully take over again, but they'll knock on the door.

2. **Notice the changes.** People around you will start responding differently—because you're behaving differently.

3. **Measure your progress.** Re-take the assessment in 30 days. See how far you've come.

**One request:**

If this program transformed something for you, I'd love to hear about it.

A quick reply with your biggest shift would mean a lot—and helps me improve for others.

**What's next:**

- AI Coach (ongoing support): [LINK]
- Advanced programs: [LINK]
- Refer a colleague: [LINK]

Thank you for trusting Character Forge with your transformation.

P.S. Your certificate of completion is attached. You earned it.

### Email 7: Day 45 - Impact Check

**Subject:** 6 weeks ago, you started Character Forge...

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

Six weeks ago, you began Character Forge.

I'm curious: **What's different now?**

- How are your team interactions different?
- What patterns have you caught and changed?
- What feedback have you received?

Most people don't measure their transformation. They just "feel" like something changed.

**But you have data.**

Re-take your assessment and compare to your original results.
[ASSESSMENT LINK]

The patterns you've transformed will show up in the numbers.

**Also:**

If you've experienced meaningful change, I'd love to feature your story (anonymously or not—your choice).

And if someone else you know could benefit from this work, the best gift you could give is an introduction.
