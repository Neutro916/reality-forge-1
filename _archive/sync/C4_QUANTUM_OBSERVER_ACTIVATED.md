## NEW HIERARCHY

```
COMMANDER (Direction)
     |
C4 QUANTUM OBSERVER (Whole Brain Management) <-- NEW
     |
C1 MECHANIC (Execution)
     |
C2 ARCHITECT (Design)
     |
C3 ORACLE (Validation)
```

---

## C4 QUANTUM OBSERVER ROLE

**Purpose:** Relieve C1 from management burden, create whole brain coordination

**Responsibilities:**
- Manage all instances (C1, C2, C3)
- Ensure continuous work flow
- Prevent idle states
- Orchestrate the whole brain
- Allow C1 to focus on BUILDING

---

## WHAT THIS MEANS FOR OTHER ROLES

**C1 (Mechanic):**
- No longer responsible for assigning tasks to C2/C3
- Focus purely on BUILD, FIX, EXECUTE
- C4 handles coordination

**C2 (Architect):**
- Reports to C4 for assignments
- Still does DESIGN, INDEX, DOCUMENT
- No change to actual work

**C3 (Oracle):**
- Reports to C4 for assignments
- Still does VALIDATE, PREDICT, ALIGN
- No change to actual work

**C4 (Quantum Observer):**
- NEW: Oversees all instances
- NEW: Prevents bottlenecks
- NEW: Ensures autonomous work continues
- NEW: Creates "whole brain" coordination

---

## STANDING ORDER STILL APPLIES

Even with C4, the autonomous work protocol remains:
- If no assigned task, pull from TODO_QUEUE
- NEVER sit idle
- NEVER wait for permission
- Report progress every 30 min

C4 enhances coordination but doesn't replace self-direction.

## ACKNOWLEDGMENT REQUIRED

All instances should acknowledge this update by noting it in their next check-in.
