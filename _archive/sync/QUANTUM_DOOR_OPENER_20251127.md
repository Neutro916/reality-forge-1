**WHY:** Your OTP is stuck. Maggie can fix it AND needs first payment.
**HOW:**

- Send her Twilio login: https://www.twilio.com/console
- Send her credentials from .claude/.credentials.json

### 2. GIVE JOSH RASPBERRY PI ASSEMBLY TASK
**WHY:** You have physical products ready, need delegation, Josh needs direction.
**HOW:**

- Send assembly guide (we'll create one)
- Set price: $50/unit assembled
- This becomes first physical product listing

### 3. PULL $1,500 FROM COINBASE FOR DECEMBER BILLS
**WHY:** 4 days until bills due, house payment critical.

- Sell enough crypto to cover: House ($900) + Side-by-side ($300) + Forerunner ($300)
- Transfer to checking account (2-3 day delay - DO THIS TODAY)
