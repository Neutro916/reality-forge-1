**Why Fourth (Not First):**
- Highest customer demand BUT
- Longest implementation time
- Should be built on validated features
- Better to prove value first, then mobile

**C3 Validation:** ALIGNED but sequence matters
**Pattern Check:** Physical domain completion

**Implementation Path:**
1. First: Validate AI coach and B2B on web
2. Then: Package proven features for mobile
3. Use React Native or Flutter for cross-platform

## ITEMS TO DEPRIORITIZE (C3 Recommendation)

### Physical Journal (#12)
**Reason:** Physical products have inventory/fulfillment complexity
**Better Alternative:** Digital journal with print-on-demand option

### Micro-lessons (#10)
**Reason:** Content creation time vs. feature development
**Better Alternative:** Auto-generate from existing Pattern Theory docs
