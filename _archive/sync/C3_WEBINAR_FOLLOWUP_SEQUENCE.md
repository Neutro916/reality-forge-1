## ATTENDEE SEQUENCE

### Email 1: Thank You + Replay (Immediate)

**Subject:** Your webinar replay + what's next

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

Thank you for spending time with me today.

If you attended live—I appreciate your presence and engagement. The questions were incredible.

**Here's your replay:**
[REPLAY LINK]
(Available for [X] days)

**What we covered:**
- The 5 patterns hiding in your leadership
- Why traditional training doesn't create change
- The pattern → recognition → transformation framework
- How to start seeing your patterns this week

**What you might be thinking:**

"I recognized myself in at least one of those patterns."
Good. That awareness is the first step.

"I want to do something about this."
That's why the Character Forge program exists.

"I'm not sure I'm ready."
Understandable. The replay is there when you are.

**The offer I mentioned:**

[WEBINAR SPECIAL OFFER]

Available until [DEADLINE].

More on this tomorrow.

### Email 2: Key Takeaways + Offer (Day 1)

**Subject:** The pattern that surprised most people

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

After yesterday's webinar, I reviewed the chat and Q&A.

**The pattern that surprised most people:**
[Pattern Name]

Here's why it's surprising:

[Explanation of why this pattern is often invisible to the person using it]

Many attendees shared some version of:
"I never thought of [behavior] as manipulation. But now I see it."

**That recognition is everything.**

Because you can't transform what you can't see.

**The Character Forge program starts where the webinar ended:**

Where the webinar gave you awareness, the program gives you:
- ✓ Your personal pattern profile (assessment)
- ✓ Real-time recognition skills (training)
- ✓ Practice conversations (AI Coach)
- ✓ Measured transformation (proof)

**Webinar special offer:**

[SPECIFIC OFFER DETAILS]

- Regular price: $[X]

### Email 3: Objection Handling (Day 2)

**Subject:** "But what if I already know my patterns?"

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

After every webinar, I get emails like this:

**"I already know I do [pattern]. Do I still need this?"**

Here's my honest answer:

Knowing you have a pattern and transforming it are very different things.

Think about it:
- Smokers know smoking is harmful
- People know they should exercise
- Leaders know they shouldn't micromanage

Knowledge doesn't change behavior. Practice does.

Character Forge isn't about learning more information.
It's about transforming automatic patterns through structured practice.

**Other questions I received:**

**"I don't have time for another program."**
The program is designed for busy leaders. 2-3 hours per week.
What's the cost of NOT transforming patterns that undermine your leadership?

**"Is this like therapy?"**
No. We're not licensed therapists. We focus specifically on leadership patterns in professional contexts. Different scope, different expertise.

**"What if it doesn't work for me?"**
We offer a transformation guarantee. Do the work, and if your patterns don't shift measurably, you get a refund.

**The webinar offer is still available:**

### Email 4: Social Proof (Day 3)

**Subject:** "I finally see what my team has been dealing with"

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

I want to share what happened for [CUSTOMER NAME/ROLE]:

---

*"Before Character Forge, I thought I was a good leader. My results said so.*

*The assessment showed me patterns I'd been blind to for years. The urgency pattern especially—I had no idea how much fear I was creating.*

*Two months in, my team started telling me things they'd never shared before. Problems I would have heard about too late, I now hear about early.*

*The biggest shift? I'm still driven. Still direct. But I'm not manipulating anymore. And everyone—including me—can feel the difference."*

— [Name], [Role], [Company if permitted]

---

**This transformation is possible for you.**

Not because you'll become someone different.
Because you'll stop running patterns that undermine who you actually are.

**The webinar offer expires tomorrow:**

After [DEADLINE], the price goes back to $[FULL PRICE].

### Email 3: Rejoin Offer (Day 2)

**Subject:** Special offer for registered non-attendees

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

You took the time to register for the webinar, so I want to make sure you don't miss the offer.

**Webinar attendees got a special price:**

[OFFER DETAILS]

Since you registered (even though you couldn't attend), I'm extending the same offer to you.

**But you need to watch the replay first.**

Not because I'm gatekeeping—because the webinar explains:
- Why this approach is different
- What you'll actually get
- Whether you're a good fit

Without that context, the offer won't make sense.

**Your two steps:**

1. Watch the replay: [REPLAY LINK]
2. Claim the offer: [OFFER LINK]

The offer expires [DEADLINE].

[NAME]

P.S. Questions about the program without watching the replay? Reply and I'll answer what I can.
