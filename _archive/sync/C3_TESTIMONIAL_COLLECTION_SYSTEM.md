## COLLECTION EMAIL TEMPLATES

### Post-Assessment (Positive Result):

**Subject:** Quick favor? (2 minutes)

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

I noticed you completed your Character Forge assessment.

I'd love to know: Did anything surprise you?

If you found the assessment valuable, would you mind sharing a quick testimonial? It helps others decide to take the first step.

Just reply to this email with:
1. What made you take the assessment?
2. What did you learn?
3. Who would you recommend it to?

Takes 2 minutes. Means a lot.

[NAME]

P.S. I read every response personally.
```

### Post-Course Completion:

**Subject:** You did it! One request...

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

Congratulations on completing Character Forge!

You've done something most leaders never do: actually transform patterns, not just learn about them.

I have a favor to ask:

Your story could help someone else decide to start their transformation. Would you share a brief testimonial?

**Quick questions to answer:**
1. What was your leadership like before Character Forge?
2. What changed during the program?
3. What's different now?
4. What would you tell someone considering it?

You can:
- Reply to this email with written answers
- Record a 2-minute video (use your phone, imperfect is fine!)
- Schedule a quick call and I'll capture your story

Whatever works for you.

[NAME]

P.S. If you're open to video, I can send easy instructions. Video testimonials are incredibly powerful.
```

### NPS Promoter Follow-up (9-10 Score):

**Subject:** Thank you for the score - one more thing?

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

You just gave Character Forge a [9/10].

That means a lot. Thank you.

Since you're recommending us to others anyway, would you be willing to share a written or video testimonial we can use?

Your words carry more weight than anything I could say.

**If written:** Just reply with a few sentences about your experience.

**If video:** I'll send easy instructions - just 2 minutes, phone is perfect.

**If neither works:** No worries at all. I appreciate the recommendation regardless.

[NAME]
```

### Video Testimonial Request:

**Subject:** Would you share your story on video?

**Body:**
```
[NAME],

I have an unusual request.

Your transformation has been inspiring to watch. I think your story could help others who are where you were.

Would you be willing to record a short video testimonial (2-3 minutes)?

**It doesn't need to be polished:**
- Phone camera is perfect
- Natural lighting (face a window)
- Casual is better than scripted
- Imperfect is more authentic

**What to talk about:**
1. Where you were before (briefly)
2. What shifted during the program
3. What's different now
4. What you'd tell someone considering it

**Easy options:**
- Record on your phone and email it back
- I send you a Loom/VideoAsk link
- We do a 15-minute Zoom call and I record

Which works best for you?

[NAME]

P.S. If you'd prefer written, that's great too. Whatever feels comfortable.
```
