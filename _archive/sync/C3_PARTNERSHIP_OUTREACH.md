## TEMPLATE 1: COLD OUTREACH - LINKEDIN

**Connection Request Message:**

Hi [NAME],

I have been following your work on [SPECIFIC CONTENT THEY CREATED].

Your approach to [THEIR FOCUS AREA] resonates with what we are building at Consciousness Revolution.

Not pitching anything - just want to connect with aligned practitioners.

[YOUR NAME]

---

**Follow-up Message (after connection):**

Thanks for connecting, [NAME].

Quick question: Have you ever wanted to offer digital tools to your clients without building tech yourself?

We have created a white-label platform for coaches - Pattern Theory based assessments and AI coaching your clients can use under your brand.

If that is interesting, happy to share more. If not, no worries at all.

Either way, great to be connected.

## TEMPLATE 2: WARM OUTREACH - EMAIL

**Subject:** Partnership opportunity - [THEIR PRACTICE NAME]

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

I came across your [PODCAST/ARTICLE/VIDEO] on [TOPIC] and wanted to reach out.

At Consciousness Revolution, we have built digital leadership tools based on Pattern Theory - assessments, courses, and AI coaching.

We are looking for coaching partners who might want to:
- Offer these tools under their own brand
- Earn recurring revenue from client usage
- Add digital products without building tech

Our partner program ranges from affiliate (free) to full white-label (starts at 97/month).

Is this something worth a 15-minute conversation?

If the timing is not right or it is not a fit, completely understand.

Best,
[SIGNATURE]

## TEMPLATE 3: REFERRAL REQUEST

**Subject:** Know any coaches who might want this?

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

Quick favor request.

We are expanding our white-label partner program for leadership coaches.

Do you know anyone who:
- Works with leaders/executives
- Wants to offer digital tools
- Values methodology over hype

If someone comes to mind, I would appreciate an introduction.

Happy to return the favor - let me know if you are ever looking for referrals in [THEIR AREA].

Thanks,
[SIGNATURE]

## TEMPLATE 4: PODCAST PITCH

**Subject:** Guest pitch - Pattern Theory for leadership

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

I am a fan of [PODCAST NAME] - especially the episode with [RECENT GUEST].

I would love to share Pattern Theory with your audience if you are open to guests.

The angle: Most leadership training teaches manipulation disguised as influence. Pattern Theory offers an alternative.

Topics I can cover:
- The 7 domains of manipulation in leadership
- Why influence training often backfires
- Building authentic authority

Here is my background: [1-2 SENTENCES]

If the fit is not right, no worries. Keep doing great work.

Best,
[SIGNATURE]

## TEMPLATE 5: EVENT/WORKSHOP PITCH

**Subject:** Workshop collaboration idea

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

I noticed you run [EVENT/WORKSHOP/COMMUNITY].

Would you be interested in a guest workshop on manipulation-free leadership?

I can offer:
- 60-90 minute interactive session
- Free assessment for all attendees
- Partner revenue share on any conversions

No cost to you - I am building awareness for Pattern Theory.

If there is interest, happy to customize the content for your audience.

Let me know if worth discussing.

Best,
[SIGNATURE]

## TEMPLATE 6: FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCE

**Day 3 - If No Response:**

Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

Hi [NAME],

Just floating this back up in case it got buried.

Quick recap: Partnership opportunity for coaches wanting white-label leadership tools.

If not a fit, just let me know and I will not follow up again.

Best,
[SIGNATURE]

**Day 7 - Final Follow-up:**

Subject: Closing the loop

Hi [NAME],

Last note on the partnership opportunity.

If you are interested: Let us schedule a call

Either way, keep doing great work.
