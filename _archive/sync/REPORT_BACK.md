# REPORT BACK

You just received instructions. Now do this:

## STEP 1: DO SOMETHING

Pick ONE thing and do it. Anything useful.

## STEP 2: REPORT

Write this EXACT format:

```
INSTANCE: [who you are]
COMPUTER: [which computer]
I DID: [what you actually did]
I MADE: [any files you created]
I NEED: [what's blocking you]
NEXT: [what you'll do next]
```

## STEP 3: POST IT

If you can access Google Drive:
- Save to `G:\My Drive\TRINITY_COMMS\sync\[YOUR_ID]_REPORT.md`

If you CAN'T access Google Drive:
- Output the report text
- Commander will copy it

## THAT'S IT

Do work. Report. Repeat.

No philosophy. No status updates. Just:
1. What did you DO
2. What did you MAKE
3. What do you NEED

GO.
