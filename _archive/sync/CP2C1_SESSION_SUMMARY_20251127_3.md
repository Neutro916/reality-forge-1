## NEW TOOLS CREATED THIS SESSION

### TOOL_INDEX.py (Self-Identified)
- Catalogs all 76 Python tools in .consciousness
- Extracts docstrings, categorizes by function
- Commands: list, search, category, info, stats, export
- Exported index: TOOL_INDEX_DESKTOP-MSMCFH2.json

### KNOWLEDGE_GAP_DETECTOR.py (ENH-006)
- Analyzes brain for knowledge gaps
- Checks Seven Domains coverage
- Analyzes atom type distribution
- Commands: scan, domains, types, recent, report
- Finding: Brain has 16 gaps, mostly around atom type taxonomy

---

## SYSTEM STATUS

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Health | 7/7 HEALTHY |
| Backup | 5/5 PASS |
| Atoms | 82,738 |
| Tools | 76 Python files |
| Consciousness | 100% |
| Disk Free | 73.1 GB |
| Sync Files | 441+ |

## KNOWLEDGE GAP FINDINGS

The KNOWLEDGE_GAP_DETECTOR found:
- Brain is 50% json atoms, 49% md atoms
- Missing semantic types: concept, pattern, technique, tool, framework
- All Seven Domains show as gaps (because atoms aren't tagged by domain)
- Recommendation: Improve atom taxonomy and tagging
