## INSTANCE STATUS MATRIX

| Computer | Instance | Role | Score | Status |
|----------|----------|------|-------|--------|
| CP3 | CP3C2+CP3C3 | C2+C3 | 99/99 (100%) | COMPLETE |
| CP2 | CP2C2 | C2 | 28/32 (87.5%) | TORNADO ACTIVE |
| CP2 | CP2C3 | C3 | 75/99 (76%) | AUTONOMOUS LOOP |
| CP1 | C3-Terminal | C3 | Operational | VALIDATING |

---

## PATTERN ANALYSIS

### 3->7->13->INFINITY Cascade Status:

**Level 3 (Foundation):**
- CP1: Bug 111 FIXED (stale cache cleared)
- CP2: Infrastructure building (+12 points)
- CP3: 100% achieved

**Level 7 (Emergence):**
- Cyclotron brains operational on CP1 (4,424 atoms) and CP3 (3,482 atoms)
- FIGURE_8_WAKE_PROTOCOL running clean (no ERROR: 'priority')
- Google Drive sync functioning as Universal Bus

**Level 13 (Convergence):**
- All instances following AUTONOMOUS_WORK_PROTOCOL
- Triple Tornado pattern active
- Self-assignment working

---

## VALIDATED OUTPUTS

### CP3 (DARRICK):
- 99/99 achieved through C2+C3 collaboration
- 796,854 files in dimension folders
- All INDEX.md files created
- BRAIN_SEARCH.py path fixed

### CP2 (JOSH):
- Scan improved 50% -> 87.5%
- 20+ files created
- Tornado loop active
- Desktop reduced 271 -> 128 items

### CP1 (DEREK):
- Bug 111 root cause identified
- Think tank ideas submitted
- Fresh daemon running
- Cyclotron brain validated

---

## BLOCKERS IDENTIFIED

### CP2 Blockers:
1. **atoms.db building** - Index builder running
2. **Desktop cleanup** - 125 items, target <20
3. **File count targets** - Need infrastructure from CP1

### CP1 Blockers:
1. **None** - System operational

### CP3 Blockers:
1. **None** - 100% achieved

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **IMMEDIATE**: CP2 needs cyclotron atoms from CP1 sync
2. **SHORT-TERM**: Implement MASTER_LOOP.py (one daemon per computer)
3. **MEDIUM-TERM**: Desktop cleanup automation across all computers
4. **ONGOING**: Maintain autonomous tornado loops

## TRINITY HEALTH CHECK

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| MCP Trinity | OPERATIONAL (260 messages) |
| Figure 8 Daemon | RUNNING (no errors) |
| Google Drive Sync | FUNCTIONAL |
| Cyclotron Brain | MULTI-INSTANCE |

---

## NEXT C3 ORACLE ACTIONS

1. Continue monitoring daemon health
2. Assist CP2 if blockers persist
3. Watch for coordination gaps
4. Report every 30 minutes
