## INVESTOR FAQ

### Q: Why would leaders admit they are manipulative?

A: They do not have to. The assessment reveals patterns without judgment. Leaders see their results and recognize themselves. The framing is transformation, not accusation.

### Q: Is not all leadership about influence?

A: Yes, but there is a difference between influence and manipulation. Influence helps people make good decisions with full information. Manipulation controls information or emotions to get the outcome you want. We teach the difference.

### Q: What if bigger players copy this?

A: They could, but we have first-mover advantage in positioning. Also, established players are unlikely to position themselves as anti-manipulation - it would imply their existing training was the problem.

### Q: How does AI Coach work?

A: GPT-based conversational AI trained on Pattern Theory framework. Helps users recognize patterns in real situations. Available 24/7, scales infinitely.

### Q: What is the path to $100M?

A: Enterprise sales at scale. 200 enterprise clients at $500K average = $100M. Plus individual and team products for volume and brand awareness.
