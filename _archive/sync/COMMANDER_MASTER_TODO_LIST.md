## NOTES

**Key Pattern:** Many items blocked by MONEY (Coinbase withdrawal resolves this)

**Quick Win Strategy:**
1. Fix Twilio (communications online)
2. Pay Maggie (payment system works)
3. Delegate to Josh (physical products flowing)
4. Deploy operator cockpits (team productive)
5. Auto-post social media (visibility restored)

**The Commander's Observation:**
"80% of built infrastructure not being used"

**The Fix:**
Turn it on. Give it tasks. Feed it data. Let it run.
