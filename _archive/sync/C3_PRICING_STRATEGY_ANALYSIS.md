## PRICING COMMUNICATION

### Value Framing:

**Assessment ($97):**
"The patterns you identify today could save years of leadership struggles and thousands in coaching fees. $97 is less than one hour of executive coaching."

**Course ($297):**
"Most leadership training costs $500-$2,000+ per day. Get a complete transformation program for the price of a business book collection."

**AI Coach ($29/mo):**
"24/7 leadership coaching support for less than a dollar a day. Executive coaching costs $300/hour. AI Coach is always available."

**Full Program ($1,997):**
"A fraction of the cost of traditional executive coaching, with ongoing AI support included. Compare to $10,000+ for similar transformation programs."

**Team Training ($7,997+):**
"Transform your entire team for less than the cost of losing one employee to turnover (average cost: $15,000-$50,000)."

### Guarantee Language:

"Complete the program, do the work. If you don't see measurable change in your leadership patterns, we'll refund your investment. We're that confident in the transformation."
