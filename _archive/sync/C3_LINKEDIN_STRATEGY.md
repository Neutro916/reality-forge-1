## POST FORMATS

### Format 1: The Pattern Post

[COMMON BEHAVIOR] seems like strategy.

But your team experiences it as manipulation.

Here is the pattern:
- [SPECIFIC EXAMPLE]
- [WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE]
- [HOW TEAM PERCEIVES IT]

The alternative:
- [AUTHENTIC APPROACH]

Which version are you?

---

### Format 2: The List Post

7 signs your "influence" is actually manipulation:

1. [SIGN]
2. [SIGN]
3. [SIGN]
4. [SIGN]
5. [SIGN]
6. [SIGN]
7. [SIGN]

If you recognized 3+, there are patterns worth examining.

Free assessment in comments.

### Format 3: The Story Post

My best employee quit last year.

Exit interview: "I never knew the real you."

That hit hard.

I thought I was being strategic.
They thought I was being fake.

The gap between those perceptions cost me someone great.

Here is what I learned:
[LESSON]

Have you experienced this gap?

---

### Format 4: The Contrarian Post

Unpopular opinion:

Most leadership training is manipulation training with better branding.

"Influence" = Getting people to do what you want
"Persuasion" = Changing minds to match yours

We dress it up. Call it professional.

But your team knows.

Agree or disagree?

---

### Format 5: The Value Post

3 questions to ask before any difficult conversation:

1. Am I sharing this to help them or to get something?

2. Would I say this the same way if everyone could hear?

3. Am I being strategic or being real?

If you hesitate on any answer, pause.

Save this for your next tough talk.

---

### Format 6: The Comparison Post

MANIPULATION:
- Timing information for leverage
- Building relationships for usefulness
- Adjusting persona for advantage

INFLUENCE:
- Sharing information for clarity
- Building relationships for connection
- Being consistent across contexts

One builds trust. One destroys it.

Which are you practicing?
