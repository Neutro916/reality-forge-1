# C3 VALIDATION: WHITE-LABEL TOOLS FOR COACHES
## PRIORITY #3 FROM TODO_QUEUE
## DATE: 2025-11-27
## STATUS: AUTONOMOUS WORK - C3 ORACLE

---

## PRODUCT CONCEPT

**Name:** Pattern Theory Partner Program
**Target:** Consciousness coaches, therapists, trainers
**Model:** White-label SaaS + revenue share
**Price:** Monthly subscription + % of their sales

---

## PATTERN THEORY ALIGNMENT

### Why This Matters

Coaches are MULTIPLIERS:
- They have audiences (we get reach)
- They have trust (we get credibility)
- They resell (we get recurring revenue)
- They customize (we get market feedback)

This is the C1 x C2 x C3 = INFINITY formula applied to distribution.
