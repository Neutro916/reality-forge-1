## VOICE ATTRIBUTES

### 1. DIRECT
We say what we mean without softening or hedging.

**Do:** "This is manipulation."
**Do Not:** "This could potentially be seen as somewhat manipulative in certain contexts."

**Do:** "Your team does not trust you."
**Do Not:** "There may be some trust challenges worth exploring."

### 2. WARM
Direct does not mean cold. We care about the people we serve.

**Do:** "This work is hard. You are not alone."
**Do Not:** "The process is straightforward if you follow the steps."

**Do:** "I hear you. That sounds frustrating."
**Do Not:** "Many people experience similar challenges."

### 3. HONEST
We tell the truth even when uncomfortable.

**Do:** "This program will not work if you are not willing to look honestly at yourself."
**Do Not:** "Results may vary based on individual engagement."

**Do:** "I do not think we are the right fit for you."
**Do Not:** "Perhaps you might want to consider other options."

### 4. GROUNDED
We are confident without arrogance. Evidence-based, not hype.

**Do:** "Leaders who complete the program report improved trust scores."
**Do Not:** "This will transform your life beyond your wildest dreams!"

**Do:** "Pattern Theory is one framework. It works for many people."
**Do Not:** "This is the only approach that works."

### 5. PROVOCATIVE
We challenge assumptions and make people think.

**Do:** "What you call influence might be manipulation with better branding."
**Do Not:** "There are different perspectives on leadership tactics."

**Do:** "Your strategic behavior is costing you trust."
**Do Not:** "Strategic approaches have both benefits and drawbacks."
