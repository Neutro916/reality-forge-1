### Problem Section

**Header:**
## Most Leadership Training Teaches Manipulation

**Body:**
Think about your last leadership training:

- "Influence" techniques
- "Getting buy-in" strategies  
- "Persuasion" tactics
- NLP patterns for "rapport"

These are just polite words for manipulation.

And it's destroying your organization:

**68%** of employees don't trust their leaders
**73%** say corporate culture is "political"
**$223B** lost annually to voluntary turnover

The problem isn't that your leaders lack skills.
The problem is they've been taught the wrong skills.

### Solution Section

**Header:**
## There's Another Way

**Body:**
What if leaders could:

✓ Achieve results WITHOUT manipulation
✓ Build trust that actually lasts
✓ Recognize when THEY'RE being manipulated
✓ Create teams that collaborate instead of compete
✓ Lead from authenticity, not tactics

That's what Manipulation-Free Leadership delivers.

### FAQ Section

**Q: How is this different from other leadership training?**
A: Most programs teach you how to influence others more effectively. We teach you how to recognize when influence crosses into manipulation—and how to achieve results without crossing that line.

**Q: Will this make me a "soft" leader?**
A: No. Manipulation-free doesn't mean pushover. You'll learn to be MORE effective by building genuine trust instead of manufactured compliance.

**Q: How long does the program take?**
A: Each module is about 2 hours. Most people complete the program in 2-4 weeks at their own pace.

**Q: Is there a guarantee?**
A: Yes. If you complete the first module and don't find it valuable, we'll refund your purchase. No manipulation required.
