**Duration:** 10-12 minutes
**Purpose:** Challenge assumptions + differentiation

**Hook (0:00-0:30)**
"'Just be authentic.' It's the most common leadership advice. It's also the most misunderstood."

- Everyone talks about authenticity
- But what does it actually mean?
- Common misinterpretations

**Misinterpretation 1: Authenticity = No Filter (2:00-4:00)**

- When authenticity becomes excuse for harm
- The pattern: authenticity as weapon

**Misinterpretation 2: Authenticity = Consistency (4:00-6:00)**
- "I'm the same everywhere"
- Context-appropriate behavior isn't fake
- The pattern: rigidity as virtue

**Misinterpretation 3: Authenticity = Feeling-Based (6:00-8:00)**
- "I have to feel it to do it"
- Professional behavior despite feelings
- The pattern: feelings as permission

**What Authentic Leadership Actually Is (8:00-10:00)**
- Alignment of values, words, actions
- Awareness of patterns and conscious choice
- Not personality expression—character expression
- The Seven Domains framework (brief)

**Wrap-up (10:00-11:00)**

## SHORT-FORM SCRIPTS (60-90 seconds)

### TikTok/Reels Script 1: "The Manipulation Red Flag"

**Hook (0:00-0:03)**
"If someone does THIS, they're manipulating you."

**Content (0:03-0:50)**
"Creating artificial urgency.

'We need to decide RIGHT NOW.'
'This opportunity won't last.'
'If you don't act today...'

Real urgent situations don't need urgency language.

Manufactured urgency is designed to bypass your thinking.

Next time someone rushes you:

Pause.
Ask: What actually happens if we wait 24 hours?

Their reaction tells you everything."

**CTA (0:50-0:60)**
"Follow for more manipulation patterns. Link in bio for the full assessment."

---

### TikTok/Reels Script 2: "Signs Your Boss Is Manipulating You"

**Hook (0:00-0:03)**
"Your boss might be manipulating you if..."

**Content (0:03-0:55)**
"Number 1: They use your guilt against you.
'After everything I've done for you...'

Number 2: They create urgency for non-urgent things.
'This HAS to be done today.'

Number 3: They share information selectively.
You find out things you should have known.

Number 4: They compare you to others.
'Sarah never pushes back like this.'

Number 5: They frame control as care.
'I'm just trying to help you...'

These patterns aren't always intentional.
But they're always damaging."

**CTA (0:55-0:60)**
"Share with someone who needs this."

---

### TikTok/Reels Script 3: "The Question Manipulators Hate"

**Hook (0:00-0:03)**
"One question shuts down most manipulation."

**Content (0:03-0:50)**
"'What would you recommend if you were in my position?'

Watch what happens.

If they're genuinely helping, they'll think about it.

If they're manipulating, they'll deflect.

'That's not the point.'
'I'm not in your position.'
'That's not how this works.'

Because manipulation requires separation.
Them influencing you.
Not them imagining being you.

This question forces perspective-taking.
And manipulation can't survive perspective."

**CTA (0:50-0:60)**
"Try it today. Report back."

## WEBINAR INTRO SCRIPT

### "5 Patterns Killing Your Leadership (And How to Fix Them)"

**Duration:** 60 minutes total, this is the opening 5-7 minutes

**Opening (0:00-0:30)**
"Welcome. I'm [NAME], and for the next hour, we're going to talk about the patterns that might be killing your leadership effectiveness—without you even knowing."

**Promise (0:30-1:30)**
"By the end of this session, you'll:
- Recognize 5 specific manipulation patterns
- Understand why you developed them
- Have a framework for transformation
- Know your next step

This isn't generic leadership advice. This is pattern-level change."

**Credibility (1:30-2:30)**
"Quick background:
[Brief relevant credentials]
[One specific transformation story]
[Why I care about this work]"

**Why This Matters (2:30-4:00)**
"Here's the thing about manipulation patterns:
- They work in the short term
- They're often unconscious
- They destroy trust over time
- And they can be transformed

Most leadership development teaches tactics.
Tactics on top of manipulation patterns don't work.

Today we go to the pattern level."

**Housekeeping (4:00-4:30)**
"This session is [interactive/recorded].
Drop questions in chat.
Slides will be available.
At the end, I'll share a special assessment offer."

**Transition (4:30-5:00)**
"Let's start with a question for you:

In the chat, share one word that describes your leadership challenge right now.

[Pause for responses]

Look at these answers. I see patterns already.

Let's dive in."

## SALES VIDEO SCRIPT

### Landing Page Video: Character Forge Overview

**Duration:** 2-3 minutes

**Hook (0:00-0:10)**
"What if your biggest leadership weakness wasn't a skill gap—but a pattern you can't see?"

**Problem (0:10-0:45)**
"Most leaders hit a ceiling.

Not because they lack knowledge.
Not because they don't work hard.
But because patterns they developed early in their careers stop working at higher levels.

Urgency that worked as a manager becomes manipulation as a director.
Confidence that earned promotion becomes arrogance that alienates.
Drive that built results builds burnout.

The patterns that got you here won't get you there."

**Solution (0:45-1:30)**
"Character Forge is different.

We don't teach more tactics.
We transform patterns.

Our assessment identifies your specific patterns.
Our program develops real-time recognition.
Our AI Coach provides ongoing support.
Our measurement proves change.

This isn't about becoming someone different.
It's about becoming more yourself—without the patterns that hold you back."

**Proof (1:30-2:00)**
"Leaders who complete our program report:
[Statistic 1]
[Statistic 2]
[Statistic 3]

[Brief testimonial clip or quote]"

**CTA (2:00-2:30)**
"Start with our free assessment.
In 10 minutes, you'll see your patterns clearly.
Then decide if you want to transform them.
