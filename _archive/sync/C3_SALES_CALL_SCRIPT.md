## PHASE 1: OPENING (3 min)

### Goal: Establish rapport and set agenda

**Script:**

"Hi [NAME], thanks for taking the time today. Before we dive in, I want to set expectations for this call.

My goal is to understand what you are dealing with and see if what we offer might help. If it is not a fit, I will tell you that directly. Sound good?

I have about [X] minutes - does that work for you?

Great. Let me start by asking..."

### Notes:
- Be genuine, not scripted-sounding
- Set collaborative tone
- Give them permission to say no

---

## PHASE 2: DISCOVERY (12 min)

### Goal: Understand their situation deeply

**Opening Question:**
"What prompted you to take the assessment / book this call?"

**Follow-up Questions:**

About the problem:
- "Tell me more about what you are experiencing with your team."
- "How long has this been going on?"
- "What have you tried already?"

About impact:
- "How is this affecting your work day-to-day?"
- "What is this costing you - in time, energy, results?"
- "If this continues unchanged, what happens?"

About goals:
- "What would success look like for you?"
- "If you could change one thing about how you lead, what would it be?"

**Listening Techniques:**
- Reflect back: "So what I hear you saying is..."
- Clarify: "Can you give me an example of that?"
- Go deeper: "Tell me more about that."

### Notes:
- Listen more than talk (80/20 rule)
- Take notes on specific language they use
- Do NOT pitch yet - just understand

---

## PHASE 3: ASSESSMENT REVIEW (8 min)

### Goal: Use their assessment as a mirror

**If they have taken assessment:**

"Let us look at your results. You scored [SCORE] out of 63, which puts you in the [ZONE] zone.

Your highest domain was [DOMAIN] at [SCORE].

What was your reaction when you saw that?"

[Let them respond]

"That domain shows up as [EXPLAIN PATTERN]. Does that resonate with what you shared earlier?"

**Connect to their story:**

"Earlier you mentioned [SPECIFIC THING THEY SAID]. I am wondering if that might be connected to this [DOMAIN] pattern. What do you think?"

**If they have NOT taken assessment:**

"Before we go further, I would love for you to take our 5-minute assessment. It will give us both a clearer picture of where to focus.

Can I send you the link right now and we can review together?"

[If yes, guide them through]
[If no, proceed with general discovery]

### Notes:
- Let assessment do the work
- Connect results to their stated problems
- Ask what THEY think, do not tell them

---

## PHASE 4: SOLUTION PRESENTATION (8 min)

### Goal: Present solution IF there is a fit

**Transition:**

"Based on what you have shared and what I see in your results, let me tell you about what might help - and you can tell me if it resonates."

**Present with their language:**

"You mentioned wanting [THEIR WORDS]. The way we approach that is through [SPECIFIC SOLUTION].

For someone in the [ZONE] zone with high [DOMAIN] scores, we typically recommend [SPECIFIC PRODUCT].

Here is what that includes:
- [Feature 1] - which addresses [their stated need]
- [Feature 2] - which helps with [their stated need]
- [Feature 3] - which supports [their stated need]"

**Share relevant story:**

"We worked with someone in a similar situation - [BRIEF CASE STUDY]. They started at [X] and after [TIMEFRAME], they [RESULT]."

**Investment:**

"The investment is [PRICE]. That includes [WHAT IS INCLUDED].

How does that land for you?"

### Notes:
- Use their words, not yours
- Connect features to their specific needs
- Be direct about price - no games
- Pause after stating price

---

## PHASE 5: QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS (8 min)

### Goal: Address concerns honestly

**Opening:**

"What questions do you have?"

[Wait for response - do not fill silence]

**Common Concerns and Responses:**

**"I need to think about it."**
"That makes sense - this is an important decision. What specifically would you want to think through? Maybe I can help clarify."

**"It is more than I expected."**
"I understand. For context, [comparison to alternatives]. But if budget is a real constraint, [lower option] might be a better starting point."

**"I am not sure it will work for me."**
"What makes you unsure? ... The guarantee is there specifically for that concern. Try Module 1 - if it is not valuable, full refund."

**"I need to check with [someone]."**
"Of course. Would it help if I sent a summary you could share? Or I could join a call with them."

**"Now is not the right time."**
"I respect that. When might be better? I am happy to follow up then."

### Notes:
- Never argue with concerns
- Explore, do not overcome
- Accept no gracefully
- Offer alternatives when appropriate

---

## PHASE 6: NEXT STEPS (5 min)

### Goal: Clear path forward

**If yes:**

"Great. Here is what happens next:
1. I will send you the payment link
2. You will get immediate access
3. I will send a welcome email with how to start
4. Any questions before we wrap up?"

**If maybe:**

"Here is what I suggest:
1. Take some time to think it through
2. I will send you [specific resource]
3. Let us schedule a brief follow-up for [date]
4. No pressure - just want to answer any questions that come up."

**If no:**

"I appreciate your honesty. The free resources are still there - assessment, email content. Maybe the timing will be better later.

Is there anything else I can help with?"

**Closing:**

"Thanks for your time today, [NAME]. Whatever you decide, I hope something from our conversation was useful."

- Budget is genuinely a hardship
