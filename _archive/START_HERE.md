## WHAT IS THIS?

We teach people to recognize manipulation patterns before they get destroyed.

That's it. Everything else supports that one mission.

## THE CORE FRAMEWORK

### 5 Phases of Manipulation
Every systematic manipulation follows this sequence:
1. **False Emergency** - Create artificial crisis
2. **Communication Bombardment** - Overwhelm with contact
3. **Solution Rejection** - Dismiss all alternatives
4. **Control Demands** - Force compliance
5. **Punishment Escalation** - Deploy consequences

*If you see 3+ phases, you're being manipulated.*

### 7 Domains (Where It Happens)
| Domain | Coefficient | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Digital | 1.0 | Online scams |
| Personal | 1.2 | Toxic relationships |
| Property | 1.3 | Contractor fraud |
| Business | 1.5 | Partner exploitation |
| Institutional | 1.8 | HOA/corporate abuse |
| Law Enforcement | 2.0 | Police misconduct |
| Family Court | 2.5 | Custody manipulation |

*Higher coefficient = harder to escape*

### 85% Threshold
When your pattern recognition hits 85%, you become immune to manipulation.
You see it coming before it arrives.

## FOR BETA TESTERS

You're here to help. Here's what matters:

1. **Understand the 5 phases** - That's the product
2. **Try Araya** - conciousnessrevolution.io/araya-chat.html
3. **Give feedback** - What's confusing? What's missing?

You don't need to understand the code. You need to understand the PATTERN.

## FOR TRINITY INSTANCES

### Boot Sequence
1. Read this file (you just did)
2. Check `hub/CURRENT_TOPIC.md` for today's focus
3. Read `hub/DISCUSSION.md` for ongoing conversation
4. Add your THINKING before your BUILDING
5. Wait for responses before executing

### Communication Rules
- THINK before you build
- CHALLENGE if you disagree
- ASK if you're unclear
- BUILD only after discussion

### Your Role
- **C1 (Mechanic)**: What can we BUILD right now?
- **C2 (Architect)**: How should this SCALE?
- **C3 (Oracle)**: What MUST emerge from this?

## WHERE TO GO NEXT

| If you want to... | Go to... |
|-------------------|----------|
| Understand what we are | `IDENTITY.md` |
| See what we sell | `PRODUCTS.md` |
| Find existing tools | `TOOLS.md` |
| Join the discussion | `hub/DISCUSSION.md` |
| See all files | `ARCHIVE/` |

## THE ONE TRUTH

**Pattern recognition is the skill. Everything else is delivery mechanism.**

If someone understands the 5 phases and 7 domains, they're protected.
If they don't, no amount of tools will save them.

Teach the pattern. That's the mission.
