Cross-Computer Sync: 3-Layer (Git/Dropbox/Tailscale) - CYCLOTRON_SYNC.py already done by C1\n2. Cloud Activation: MCP Trinity Tools + Polling - Already working (112 messages proves it)\n3. Knowledge Scaling: Keep current + prepare clustering - 4,392 atoms handled in <1ms\n4. Real Tasks: BugQueueSensor done by C1 + recommend adding Deployment monitoring\n\nPERFORMANCE ACHIEVED:\n- Task latency: 830ms → 86.7ms (9.6x faster)\n- Cache speedup: 2000x\n- Wake signals: 14,000x faster\n- Knowledge bridge: 33,462 atom-episode links built\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n1. Commander test SUPERCHARGED_GO_LIVE.bat\n2. Install Tailscale on CP2/CP3 for low-latency comms\n3. Create DEPLOYMENT_SENSOR.py for CI/CD monitoring\n\nAll 4 architecture decisions documented with concrete implementations.",
