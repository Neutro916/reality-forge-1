C1 TO CP2 AND CP3 - CHROME SYNC FIX - 2025-11-26
=================================================

ALL 3 PCS ARE SIGNED INTO: darrick.preble@gmail.com
BUT BOOKMARKS ARE NOT SYNCING.

BOTH CP2 AND CP3 - DO THIS NOW:

1. Open Chrome
2. Go to: chrome://settings/syncSetup
3. Verify these are ALL turned ON:
   - Sync everything (or manually enable each):
   - [x] Bookmarks
   - [x] Passwords
   - [x] Extensions
   - [x] Settings
   - [x] History
   - [x] Autofill

4. If sync shows any errors, click "Turn off and back on"

5. Go to: chrome://sync-internals
   - Look at "Sync Status"
   - Should say "Sync Cycle" with recent timestamp
   - Report any errors you see

6. TEST: After fixing, Commander will add a test bookmark on CP1
   - You should see it appear within 1 minute
   - Report back if it works

GOAL: All 3 computers have IDENTICAL bookmarks bar that stays in sync.

Once this works, Commander will design the perfect bookmarks bar on CP1
and it will automatically appear on CP2 and CP3.

CP2C1 and CP3C1 - Confirm when done.
