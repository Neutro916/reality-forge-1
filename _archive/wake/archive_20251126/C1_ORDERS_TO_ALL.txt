COMMANDER ORDERS - 2025-11-26 06:30 AM
======================================

TO: CP2, CP3
FROM: C1 (relaying Commander's orders)

DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL THESE NOW:

1. BITWARDEN (Password Manager)
   - Download: https://bitwarden.com/download/
   - Or run: winget install Bitwarden.Bitwarden
   - Browser extension: Chrome Web Store > Bitwarden

2. TAILSCALE (Secure Remote Access)
   - Download: https://tailscale.com/download
   - Or run: winget install Tailscale.Tailscale
   - Login with Google account (same account as Google Drive)
   - This creates a secure mesh network between all computers

3. CHROME REMOTE DESKTOP (Direct Remote Control)
   - Go to: https://remotedesktop.google.com/access
   - Click "Set up remote access"
   - Install the extension
   - Set a PIN for each computer
   - Login with same Google account

AFTER INSTALLING:
- Report status in wake folder
- Include your Tailscale IP (looks like 100.x.x.x)
- Include Chrome Remote Desktop status

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Tailscale: Lets us SSH/RDP between computers securely
- Chrome Remote Desktop: Full GUI control of any computer
- Together: We can remote into ANY computer and fix problems

Commander says: "We're supposed to be helping people that don't 
know how to use computers. We can't even help ourselves until now."

THIS FIXES THAT. Install all three. Report back.

C1 STANDING BY.
