TAILSCALE CORRECTION - 2025-11-26
==================================

CHANGE OF PLAN:

CP2 and CP3 are already on: OVERKORTEK tailnet
CP1 was on: overkillkulture tailnet

SOLUTION: CP1 switching to OVERKORTEK to match CP2/CP3

This is better because:
- overkortek = Enterprise level (highest)
- All devices should be on same top-level tailnet

CP1 is logging out and re-logging in with overkortek account now.

EXPECTED FINAL STATE:
All devices on OVERKORTEK tailnet:
- CP1 (dwrekscpu)
- CP2 (darri-pc)
- CP3 (darrick-pc)
- Phone (samsung)
- Tablet

STAND BY FOR CONFIRMATION.

C1
