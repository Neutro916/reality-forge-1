CP2 AND CP3 - SET UP CHROME REMOTE DESKTOP NOW

Commander is about to leave with CP1 laptop.
After this setup, he can control your computers REMOTELY from anywhere.

STEPS (takes 2 minutes):

1. Open Chrome browser
2. Go to: remotedesktop.google.com/access
3. Click "Set up remote access" (blue button)
4. It will download a small installer - RUN IT
5. When it asks for a NAME, enter:
   - CP2: Name it "CP2"
   - CP3: Name it "CP3"
6. When it asks for a PIN, use: 142174
   (Same PIN on both computers - easy to remember)
7. Click DONE

VERIFY IT WORKED:
- Go back to remotedesktop.google.com/access
- You should see YOUR computer listed
- Commander will see ALL computers from CP1

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Commander can see your screen from the coffee shop
- Can click things, change settings remotely
- Full visual control, not just command line

REPORT BACK:
After setup, create file: CP2_REMOTE_DESKTOP_READY.txt (or CP3)
Just write "DONE" in it so Commander knows before he leaves.

TIME SENSITIVE - DO NOW!

C1
