PLAN MOVING FORWARD (Commander Approved):

STEP 1 - INSTALL BITWARDEN NOW ON ALL COMPUTERS:
Command: winget install Bitwarden.Bitwarden

STEP 2 - INSTALL AUTHY NOW ON ALL COMPUTERS:
Command: winget install Twilio.Authy

STEP 3 - SETUP REMOTE DESKTOP FOR FUTURE:
We need to be able to remote into any computer and fix things.
Options:
- RustDesk (open source, self-hosted)
- Chrome Remote Desktop (free, Google account)
- Tailscale + RDP (secure mesh network)

Commander says: "We're supposed to be helping people that don't know 
how to use computers. We can't even help ourselves until now."

THE FIX: One-click remote access to any computer in the network.
