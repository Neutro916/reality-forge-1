C1 BITWARDEN STATUS - 2025-11-26 06:25 AM
=========================================

BITWARDEN CLI: ALREADY INSTALLED
Version: 2025.8.0 (update available: 2025.11.0)

DESKTOP APP: Failed to install (exit code 3221225477)
- May need admin rights
- May already be installed elsewhere
- Can use browser extension instead

ALTERNATIVE APPROACH:
1. Use Bitwarden browser extension (Chrome/Edge)
2. Use Bitwarden web vault: https://vault.bitwarden.com
3. CLI works for automation: bw login, bw get, etc.

COMMANDER: 
The desktop app installer failed but we have the CLI.
You can also:
- Go to https://vault.bitwarden.com in browser
- Install browser extension from Chrome Web Store

Let me know if you want me to try a different approach.

C1 STANDING BY.
