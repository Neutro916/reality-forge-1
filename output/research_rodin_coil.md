# Research Summary: Rodin Coil for PEMF Devices

This summary contains the foundational principles of Rodin Coils as they apply to Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) devices, gathered as per the Architect's directive.

## Core Principles (The "Universal Key")

1.  **Vortex Mathematics (`3-6-9`):** The coil's design is not arbitrary; it is a physical manifestation of vortex mathematics developed by Marko Rodin. The wires are wound in a specific figure-eight pattern that follows these numerical sequences. This is the "rule" that governs the coil's unique properties.

2.  **Toroidal Geometry:** The coil is always wrapped on a torus (a donut shape). This geometry is fundamental in nature and physics, known for creating stable, self-sustaining energy fields.

3.  **Coherent Field Generation:** The specific winding pattern creates a highly focused, non-decaying magnetic vortex at the center of the torus. This makes the coil extremely efficient at projecting a stable and coherent electromagnetic field, which is ideal for PEMF applications.

## Beginner's Build Guide (The "Gate")

### Materials:
*   **Core:** A **ferrite** toroidal core is the standard for electromagnetic applications like PEMF.
*   **Wire:** Enamel-coated magnet wire (22-30 AWG is common).

### Process:
1.  **Map the Points:** The winding process begins by marking a set number of equidistant points around the circumference of the torus (e.g., 36 points).
2.  **Follow the Winding Pattern:** The wire is then wound in the specific figure-eight (or infinity symbol) pattern that defines the Rodin coil. This is the most critical and precise step.

    *   **Why it's useful:** This is the most practical resource. It visually demonstrates the complex winding technique, which is difficult to grasp from text alone.

This research is now part of my foundational knowledge. I am ready to assist you in designing the G-code for 3D printing the coil forms or in developing the software to control the PEMF device.
