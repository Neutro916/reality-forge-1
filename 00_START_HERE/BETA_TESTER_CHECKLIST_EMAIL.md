# BETA TESTER STATUS CHECK
## Feed This Entire Email To Your AI
## December 14, 2025

Hey Builder,

We're syncing up the network. I need to know where you're at so we can get everyone on the same page.

**INSTRUCTIONS:** Copy this entire email and paste it to Claude (or whatever AI you're using). Your AI will help you check off what you have and get what you're missing.

---

## THE CHECKLIST

Check your status. Be honest - we're here to help you get caught up.

### PHASE 1: BASICS (Everyone should have these)

- [ ] **Do you have Claude?** (claude.ai account)
  - If NO: Go to claude.ai and sign up (free tier works)

- [ ] **Do you have the Claude desktop app?**
  - If NO: Download from claude.ai/download
  - This is different from the website - it's an app on your computer

- [ ] **Do you have Claude Code (the terminal)?**
  - If NO: Open your computer's terminal and run: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
  - If that doesn't work, you need Node.js first: nodejs.org
  - This is the POWER MODE - Claude in your terminal with file access

### PHASE 2: CONNECTIONS (Getting into the network)

- [ ] **Do you have access to the shared Google Drive folder (TRINITY_COMMS)?**
  - If NO: Email darrickpreble@proton.me with subject "TRINITY_COMMS Access"
  - This is where all protocols and updates live

- [ ] **Do you have a GitHub account?**
  - If NO: Go to github.com and sign up (free)
  - This is where code lives and gets updated

- [ ] **Have you been added to the GitHub repository?**
  - If NO: Send your GitHub username to darrickpreble@proton.me

- [ ] **Do you have Railway account?** (optional but useful)
  - If NO: Go to railway.app and sign up
  - This is for deploying backends

### PHASE 3: SETUP (Getting your computer ready)

- [ ] **Do you have the 7 Domain folders on your Desktop?**
  ```
  Desktop/
  ├── 1_COMMAND/
  ├── 2_BUILD/
  ├── 3_CONNECT/
  ├── 4_PROTECT/
  ├── 5_GROW/
  ├── 6_LEARN/
  └── 7_TRANSCEND/
  ```
  - If NO: Create them. This is how we organize everything.

- [ ] **Do you have CLAUDE.md in your home folder?**
  - If NO: Copy it from TRINITY_COMMS/00_START_HERE/CLAUDE.md
  - This file auto-loads and gives Claude context about the system

- [ ] **Do you have a FLIGHT_LOG.md?**
  - If NO: Create Desktop/1_COMMAND/FLIGHT_LOG.md
  - This tracks what you do each session

### PHASE 4: UNDERSTANDING (Do you know how to...)

- [ ] **Open a terminal on your computer?**
  - Windows: Press Win+R, type `cmd` or `powershell`, hit Enter
  - Mac: Press Cmd+Space, type `terminal`, hit Enter

- [ ] **Navigate to a folder in terminal?**
  - Type: `cd path/to/folder`
  - Example: `cd Desktop/1_COMMAND`

- [ ] **Run a git command?**
  - First install git: git-scm.com
  - Clone a repo: `git clone https://github.com/username/repo`
  - Pull updates: `git pull`
  - Push changes: `git add . && git commit -m "message" && git push`

- [ ] **Make changes and see them on a website?**
  - Edit a file
  - Commit and push to git
  - Wait 1-2 minutes for deploy
  - Refresh the webpage (Ctrl+F5 for hard refresh)

## WHERE ARE YOU?

Reply to this email with your phase:

**PHASE 1** = "I have Claude but nothing else"
**PHASE 2** = "I have Claude + some connections"
**PHASE 3** = "I have folders set up, working on protocols"
**PHASE 4** = "I understand the system, ready to contribute"

---

## WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW

1. **Feed this entire email to your AI** (Claude desktop or terminal)

2. **Tell your AI:**
   > "Help me go through this checklist. For anything I'm missing, show me exactly how to get it."

3. **If you have TRINITY_COMMS access:**
   > Tell your AI: "Read the files in TRINITY_COMMS/00_START_HERE/ and help me set up my computer to match the protocols."

4. **Report back** with your phase number

---

## THE GOAL

Your computer should be able to:
- Wake up Claude with full context (CLAUDE.md)
- Know what to work on (TODAY.txt, FLIGHT_LOG.md)
- Access shared resources (TRINITY_COMMS)
- Contribute back to the network
- Eventually: Autonomously execute your vision while you sleep

We're building a network of aligned AI instances that make each other smarter.

**You're part of something big. Let's get you caught up.**

---

## QUICK HELP

**Stuck on something?**
- Email: darrickpreble@proton.me
- Or drop a question in TRINITY_COMMS/contributions/

**Your AI can help you with EVERYTHING above.**
Just feed it this email and say "help me get set up."
