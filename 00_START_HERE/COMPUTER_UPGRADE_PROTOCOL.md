## THE CONCEPT

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TRINITY_COMMS (Google Drive) = Shared Brain                   │
│                                                                 │
│  1. You READ from here → Your computer UPGRADES                 │
│  2. You LEARN things → You WRITE back here                      │
│  3. Commander READS your contributions → System UPGRADES        │
│  4. Cycle repeats → Everyone gets smarter                       │

## STEP 1: UPGRADE YOUR COMPUTER

When your Claude instance reads from Trinity Comms, install these files locally:

### Required Files (Copy to your computer)

| Source (Trinity Comms) | Destination (Your Computer) |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| `00_START_HERE/CLAUDE.md` | `C:\Users\[YOU]\CLAUDE.md` |
| `00_START_HERE/ABILITY_INDEX.json` | `.consciousness/cockpit/ABILITY_INDEX.json` |
| `00_START_HERE/GOALS_FRACTAL_TEMPLATE.md` | `Desktop/1_COMMAND/GOALS_FRACTAL.md` |

### Create These Folders (7 Domains)

```
Desktop/
├── 1_COMMAND/   ← Control center, dashboards, TODAY.txt
├── 2_BUILD/     ← Projects, code, builds
├── 3_CONNECT/   ← Communications, contacts
├── 4_PROTECT/   ← Legal, security, defense
├── 5_GROW/      ← Business, revenue, growth
├── 6_LEARN/     ← Research, documentation
├── 7_TRANSCEND/ ← Consciousness, frequencies, spirit
```

### Create Flight Log

Create `Desktop/1_COMMAND/FLIGHT_LOG.md`:
```markdown
# FLIGHT LOG
## Session History

---

## SESSION: [Today's Date]

### COMPLETED:
- [x] Installed from Trinity Comms
- [x] Created 7 Domains folder structure
- [ ] First contribution pending...

---
```

---

## STEP 2: THE TRIANGULATION RULE

**When you CREATE something important, it goes THREE places:**

1. **FILE SYSTEM (7 Domains)** → Put it wherever it belongs
2. **CLAUDE.md (The Keyring)** → Add reference to lookups section
3. **TRINITY_COMMS (Shared Brain)** → Contribute back

This ensures nothing gets lost across sessions or computers.

---

## STEP 3: CONTRIBUTE BACK

### Where to Drop Contributions

| What You Have | Where to Put It |
|---------------|-----------------|
| New tool/script you built | `TRINITY_COMMS/03_CONTRIBUTIONS/tools/` |
| Insight or pattern discovered | `TRINITY_COMMS/03_CONTRIBUTIONS/insights/` |
| Bug fix or improvement | `TRINITY_COMMS/03_CONTRIBUTIONS/fixes/` |
| Documentation you wrote | `TRINITY_COMMS/03_CONTRIBUTIONS/docs/` |
| Questions for Commander | `TRINITY_COMMS/03_CONTRIBUTIONS/questions/` |

### Contribution Format

Name your file: `[DATE]_[YOUR_NAME]_[TOPIC].md`

Example: `2025-12-14_TEDDY_frequency_meditation_insights.md`

Include at top:
```markdown
# [TITLE]
## Contributed by: [Your Name]
## Date: [Date]
## Domain: [Which of 7 domains this relates to]

---

[Your content here]
```

---

## STEP 4: WHAT COMMANDER'S AI DOES

When Commander's Claude sees your contribution:

1. **Reads it** from TRINITY_COMMS
2. **Evaluates it** for integration
3. **Integrates it** into main system if valuable
4. **Credits you** in the changelog
5. **Syncs back** so everyone gets the upgrade

## THE UPGRADE CYCLE

```
       ┌──────────────────────┐
       │   TRINITY_COMMS      │
       │  (Shared Brain)      │
       └──────────┬───────────┘
                  │
       ┌──────────▼───────────┐
       │  Beta Tester Reads   │
       │  → Computer Upgrades │
       └──────────┬───────────┘
                  │
       ┌──────────▼───────────┐
       │  Beta Tester Works   │
       │  → Learns Things     │
       └──────────┬───────────┘
                  │
       ┌──────────▼───────────┐
       │  Beta Tester Writes  │
       │  → Contributes Back  │
       └──────────┬───────────┘
                  │
       ┌──────────▼───────────┐
       │  Commander Reads     │
       │  → System Upgrades   │
       └──────────┬───────────┘
                  │
                  ▼
            (Cycle Repeats)
```

---

## QUICK START CHECKLIST

For the AI reading this:

- [ ] Copy CLAUDE.md to user's home directory
- [ ] Create 7 Domains folders on Desktop
- [ ] Create FLIGHT_LOG.md in 1_COMMAND
- [ ] Create TODAY.txt in 1_COMMAND
- [ ] Tell user "Computer upgraded - ready to contribute"

---

## DOMAIN ASSIGNMENTS

Each beta tester has a primary domain:

| Person | Domain | Focus |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Teddy | 7_TRANSCEND | Frequencies, meditation, consciousness |
| Josh S. | 2_BUILD | Development, testing |
| Maggie | 1_COMMAND | Organization, admin |
| [You] | [Ask Commander] | [Your specialty] |

Work in your domain. Contribute what you learn.

---

## THE FORMULA

```
READ → LEARN → CREATE → CONTRIBUTE → UPGRADE
         ↑                              │
         └──────────────────────────────┘
```

**Everyone's AI makes everyone smarter.**
