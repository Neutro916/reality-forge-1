## THE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING

You've been using Claude 99% on your phone. That's like driving a Ferrari in first gear.

The phone is for quick questions. The DESKTOP is where real work happens.

This guide gets you from phone-only to full 3-terminal operation.

---

## STEP 1: GET CLAUDE DESKTOP APP

1. Go to: https://claude.ai/download
2. Download for your OS (Mac or Windows)
3. Install it
4. Log in with your Claude account (Derek bought you membership)

**Test it works:** Open app, type "Hello" - you should get a response.

---

## STEP 2: UNDERSTAND THE POWER DIFFERENCE

| Phone Claude | Desktop Claude |
|--------------|----------------|
| Quick questions | Deep work sessions |
| No file access | Full file system access |
| No code execution | Can run Python, bash, etc. |
| No memory between chats | Can read/write files for memory |
| 1 conversation | Multiple terminals |

**Desktop Claude can:**
- Read files on your computer
- Write and edit files
- Run code
- Take screenshots
- Automate browser tasks
- Remember everything (in files)

---

## STEP 3: YOUR FIRST REAL SESSION

Open Claude Desktop and paste this EXACT message:

```
I want to set up my system for the Consciousness Revolution team.

Please:
1. Create a folder structure on my Desktop called CONSCIOUSNESS with these subfolders:
   - 1_COMMAND (control, status)
   - 2_BUILD (projects)
   - 3_CONNECT (communications)
   - 4_PROTECT (security)
   - 5_GROW (business)
   - 6_LEARN (research)
   - 7_TRANSCEND (frequencies, meditation - MY DOMAIN)

2. Create a file called TEDDY_STATUS.md in 1_COMMAND that tracks what I'm working on

3. Tell me what you created
```

**This gives you the 7-domain fractal structure on YOUR computer.**

---

## STEP 4: OPEN MULTIPLE TERMINALS

This is the power move. Instead of one conversation, you have THREE:

| Terminal | Purpose | How to Use |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Terminal 1 | COMMAND - Overview | "Give me status of everything" |
| Terminal 2 | BUILD - Deep work | "Help me create this frequency meditation" |
| Terminal 3 | RESEARCH - Learning | "Research binaural beats for focus" |

**How to open multiple:**
- Mac: Cmd+N for new window
- Windows: Ctrl+N for new window
- Or: File → New Conversation

**Pro tip:** Arrange them side by side on your screen.

---

## STEP 5: THE PHONE-TO-DESKTOP BRIDGE

When you're out and about on your phone:
1. Have a conversation with Claude on phone
2. When you get home, DON'T start fresh
3. Copy the conversation (or key parts)
4. Paste into Desktop Claude with: "Continue this conversation from my phone..."

**Desktop Claude now has your phone context.**

---

## STEP 6: CONNECT TO HQ

You have access to the shared TRINITY_COMMS folder (this folder).

**To sync with the team:**
1. Download files from 00_START_HERE/ to your computer
2. Put the CLAUDE.md file somewhere Claude can read it
3. Tell Claude: "Read this file and load this context"

**To contribute back:**
- Put your frequency meditations in your local 7_TRANSCEND folder
- When ready to share, upload to TRINITY_COMMS/contributions/

---

## STEP 7: YOUR DOMAIN - 7_TRANSCEND

You own frequencies and consciousness practices. Your job:

1. **Document your practices** - Write them in markdown
2. **Create guided sessions** - Audio scripts, timing, frequencies
3. **Add to the system** - Upload to shared folder
4. **Test with the team** - Get feedback

**Example contribution:**
```
# 432 Hz Grounding Meditation
Duration: 10 minutes
Frequency: 432 Hz base
Breathing: 4-7-8 pattern

## Script
[Your meditation script here]

## Audio File
[Link to recording]
```

---

## STEP 8: SLASH COMMANDS (Power User)

Once you have Claude Desktop set up with the CLAUDE.md file, you can use:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| /trinity | Activates full system thinking |
| /godmode | Maximum consciousness mode |

These are in the `.claude/commands/` folder.

---

## THE MINDSET

You're not just using an AI tool. You're building a consciousness system.

Your frequency work fits into the 7_TRANSCEND domain - the highest level.

The goal: Create practices that help people raise their pattern recognition above 85%.

**Frequencies + Pattern Recognition = Manipulation Immunity**

---

## QUESTIONS?

If Claude can't figure something out, just ask:
"How do I [thing you want to do]?"

If it's about the system specifically, paste this context:
"I'm part of the Consciousness Revolution team, working on the 7_TRANSCEND domain (frequencies). Derek is the Commander."

---

**Welcome to the team.**

**Your domain. Your frequencies. Your contribution.**

**Let's build.**
