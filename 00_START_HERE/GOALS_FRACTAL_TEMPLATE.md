# HOW TO USE THIS FILE

1. **Start of day:** Check DAILY section
2. **Planning session:** Update WEEKLY
3. **Week end:** Review MONTHLY progress
4. **Month end:** Update YEARLY goals
5. **Quarterly:** Check 5-YEAR alignment
6. **Annually:** Revisit VISION

---

# THE FRACTAL RULE

```
Every level feeds the next:
- TODAY's tasks → This WEEK's goals
- This WEEK's goals → This MONTH's theme
- This MONTH's theme → This YEAR's milestones
- This YEAR's milestones → 5-YEAR trajectory
- 5-YEAR trajectory → 10-YEAR vision
- 10-YEAR vision → ∞ NORTH STAR
```

**If a daily task doesn't connect to the vision, question why you're doing it.**

# UPDATE PROTOCOL

When you update the FLIGHT_LOG at session end:
1. Check off completed DAILY tasks
2. Add any new blockers
3. Update WEEKLY if needed
