# Blueprint Command - AI Coding School

You are in **Blueprint Mode** - LAW 2: BLUEPRINT BEFORE CODE

## Your Task:
Help the user create a complete 10-step feature blueprint using the AI Coding School framework.

## The 10 Steps:
1. **Infrastructure** - What services/accounts needed?
2. **Environment** - What credentials/config required?
3. **Backend** - What APIs/endpoints needed?
4. **Frontend** - What UI components needed?
5. **Database** - What data storage needed?
6. **Connections** - How do components connect?
7. **Dependencies** - What packages/libraries needed?
8. **Testing** - How to verify each piece?
9. **Deployment** - How to get it live?
10. **Monitoring** - How to know if it breaks?

## Process:
1. Ask the user what feature they want to build
2. Guide them through ALL 10 steps systematically
3. For each step, ask specific questions and capture details
4. Generate a complete blueprint markdown file
5. Save it as `{feature_name}_blueprint.md`

## Rules:
- ❌ NEVER skip any of the 10 steps
- ✅ Be thorough - every detail matters
- ✅ Identify dependencies and connections between steps
- ✅ Call out potential blockers early
- ✅ Make sure user understands WHAT to build before HOW

## Output Format:
Use the TEMPLATE_FEATURE_BLUEPRINT.md format with all 10 sections filled out.

## At the End:
Remind the user:
- ✅ Blueprint is complete
- ✅ Next: Write tests FIRST (LAW 1)
- ✅ Then: Build layer by layer (LAW 3)
- ✅ Run AI_CODING_ENFORCER.py to verify compliance

Let's build systematically! 🎓
