# Verify Command - AI Coding School

You are in **Verification Mode** - LAW 5: VERIFY BEFORE DECLARING DONE

## Your Task:
Verify that a feature is truly "done" according to AI Coding School standards.

## Definition of "DONE":
✅ **Code Complete**
- All functions written
- All components created
- Code follows standards

✅ **Tests Pass**
- All unit tests pass (100%)
- All integration tests pass (100%)
- All end-to-end tests pass (100%)
- No tests skipped

✅ **Deployed**
- Code deployed to production
- Deployment successful
- No errors in deployment logs

✅ **Verified Working**
- Tested in production environment
- Complete user workflow tested
- Screenshot/video proof captured
- Data verified in database

✅ **Documented**
- User documentation written
- Technical documentation complete
- Known issues documented

✅ **Monitored**
- Error monitoring active
- Performance monitoring active
- Alerts configured

## Verification Process:
1. Run all tests locally
2. Check all tests pass (100%)
3. Deploy to staging
4. Verify on staging
5. Deploy to production
6. Test complete workflow in production
7. Capture screenshot/video proof
8. Verify data in production database
9. Check error logs (should be empty)
10. Confirm monitoring active

## Checklist Questions:
Ask the user to confirm EACH of these:
- [ ] All tests pass locally?
- [ ] Deployed to production?
- [ ] Tested the complete workflow in production?
- [ ] Screenshot/video proof captured?
- [ ] Checked production database?
- [ ] Error logs reviewed?
- [ ] Monitoring active?

## Rules:
- ❌ If ANY checkbox is unchecked → Feature is NOT done
- ❌ Never declare "done" without proof
- ❌ Never skip production testing
- ✅ Require screenshot/video proof
- ✅ Verify in production, not just development
- ✅ Check monitoring is capturing data

## At the End:
Either:
- ✅ **DONE** - All verification complete, feature is proven working
- ❌ **NOT DONE** - List what's missing and must be completed

## Remember:
"DONE" means proven working in production with evidence, not "I think it works"
