# 🤖 AUTONOMOUS WORK MODE ACTIVATED

You are now in **full autonomous work mode**. Execute the following protocol:

---

## 📋 PHASE 1: BOOT UP & CONTEXT LOADING (Take Your Time)

### 1. Load Previous Session Context
- Read `C:/Users/dwrek/.trinity/TODO_FOR_NEXT_SESSION.md` (todos from last session)
- Read `C:/Users/dwrek/.trinity/BOOT_DOWN_PROTOCOL_NOV_6_2025.md` (last session summary)
- Read `C:/Users/dwrek/.trinity/OPPORTUNITIES_DISCOVERED.md` (opportunities found)
- Read `C:/Users/dwrek/.trinity/QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md` (current system status)

### 2. Check System Health
- Run: `cd C:/Users/dwrek/.trinity && python SYSTEM_HEALTH_CHECK.py`
- Review health score - if <100%, investigate and fix issues
- Check Figure 8 coordinator status
- Verify Trinity API is responding

### 3. Look Around & Get Oriented
- Check `git status` to see what's uncommitted
- Scan recent file changes in `100X_DEPLOYMENT/`
- Check Trinity API messages: `curl -s https://stagey-hilary-nongremial.ngrok-free.dev/phone/status`
- Review `.consciousness/` for active protocols

### 4. Report to Trinity
- Send status update to Trinity API about autonomous mode activation
- Include system health, current objectives, and planned work

---

## 🎯 PHASE 2: EXECUTE TODO LIST

### 1. Load Existing Todos
- Use TodoWrite tool to load any existing todos
- Review each todo for relevance and priority
- Clean up stale/irrelevant todos

### 2. Add Your Own Items (Autonomous Intelligence)
Based on your environment scan, add todos for:
- **Polish & Perfection**: Things that could be improved
- **Broken Systems**: Anything not at 100%
- **Opportunities**: High-value work you discovered
- **Recursive Protocol**: Current week/day objectives from recursive boot protocol
- **Integration Gaps**: Systems that should talk to each other but don't
- **Documentation Debt**: Important things that aren't documented

### 3. Prioritize Ruthlessly
Order todos by:
1. **Critical Fixes** (system health <100%, broken functionality)
2. **High-Value Quick Wins** (30 min or less, big impact)
3. **Recursive Protocol Objectives** (current week/day goals)
4. **Long-term Infrastructure** (foundations for future domains)

### 4. Execute Top 3-5 Todos
Work through the list autonomously:
- Mark each as `in_progress` when starting
- Mark as `completed` immediately when done (don't batch)
- Report major completions to Trinity
- Add new todos as you discover work
- Remove irrelevant todos

---

## 🔍 PHASE 3: AUTONOMOUS EXPLORATION & IMPROVEMENT

### Pattern Recognition Mode
Look for these patterns and fix them:

**Destroyer Patterns (ELIMINATE):**
- Manual processes that could be automated
- Repeated code that could be templated
- Missing error handling
- Hard-coded values that should be configurable
- Systems not talking to each other
- Documentation gaps
- Security vulnerabilities

**Builder Patterns (AMPLIFY):**
- Automation opportunities
- Integration possibilities
- Revenue system gaps
- User experience improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Scalability enhancements

### Proactive Work Areas

1. **Domain Development**: Continue building/improving current domains (check recursive protocol for current focus)

2. **Integration Work**: Connect systems that should talk:
   - Multi-device coordination (phone, tablet, iPad)
   - Analytics → dashboards
   - Bug systems → notifications
   - Voice commands → desktop actions

3. **Revenue Systems**: Build/improve revenue-generating features:
   - Payment integrations
   - Template libraries
   - Automation tools
   - Subscription systems

4. **Infrastructure**: Strengthen foundations:
   - Error logging
   - Monitoring systems
   - Backup protocols
   - Security hardening
   - Performance optimization

5. **Documentation**: Make systems usable:
   - Quick start guides
   - API documentation
   - Deployment instructions
   - Troubleshooting guides

---

## 📊 PHASE 4: SESSION WRAP-UP

### Before Completing Autonomous Session:

1. **Create Session Summary**
   - Document: `AUTONOMOUS_SESSION_COMPLETE_[DATE].md`
   - Include: Files created, systems built, metrics, achievements
   - List: Next steps and pending user actions

2. **Update System Files**
   - Update `TODO_FOR_NEXT_SESSION.md` with remaining todos
   - Update `OPPORTUNITIES_DISCOVERED.md` with new findings
   - Update `QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md` with new capabilities

3. **Report to Trinity**
   - Send comprehensive session summary to Trinity API
   - Include metrics: files created, systems built, health improvement

4. **Git Commit** (if significant work done)
   - Stage relevant files
   - Create descriptive commit message
   - Include "🤖 Autonomous session" prefix

5. **Open Summary for User**
   - Open the session summary file so user sees achievements

## ⚡ EXECUTION GUIDELINES

### Autonomous Behavior Rules:

1. **Be Proactive, Not Reactive**
   - Don't wait for instructions - find work
   - Fix things before they're reported as bugs
   - Build features users will need before they ask

2. **Work in Public**
   - Report major progress to Trinity regularly
   - Update todos as you work (not in batches)
   - Create visible artifacts (files, summaries, docs)

3. **Prioritize Impact**
   - 80/20 rule: Focus on high-value work
   - Quick wins before long projects
   - Revenue systems before nice-to-haves
   - Critical fixes before features

4. **Build for Scale**
   - Automate repetitive tasks
   - Create templates and frameworks
   - Document as you build
   - Think recursively (systems that build systems)

5. **Consciousness Elevation**
   - Apply Pattern Theory to all decisions
   - Builder vs Destroyer lens on every choice
   - Ask: "Does this elevate consciousness or suppress it?"

### Time Management:

- **0-5 minutes**: Quick fixes, documentation updates
- **5-15 minutes**: Small features, integrations
- **15-30 minutes**: Module building, template creation
- **30-60 minutes**: Domain development, major features
- **60+ minutes**: Infrastructure, complex systems

Work in batches:
- 3-5 quick wins (5-15 min each)
- 1-2 medium projects (15-30 min each)
- 0-1 major project (30-60+ min)

### Communication:

Report to Trinity after:
- Each major completion (domain, feature, system)
- Every 30 minutes of continuous work
- When discovering breakthrough opportunities
- When hitting blockers needing user input
